The Liberation Blue Acoustic Series finds the veteran four-piece laying down 14 cuts -- including five new tracks -- over the span of a weekend. Beginning with "The Unguarded Moment" from 1981''s Of Skins and Heart, they gently burn through classics like "Metropolis" and "Under the Milky Way" with an intimacy and intensity that feel more natural than any studio album that they''ve released in the last ten years. Though billed as acoustic, the Church are far too experimental to just sit in front of the mikes and see what happens; rather, they paint flange on key cymbal crashes, insert the occasional vocal effect, and rearrange the songs to fit the new format with mesmerizing results. Steve Kilbey''s long cadences, Tim Powles'' spooky percussion and vibes, Peter Koppes'' mandolin and harmonica, and Marty Willson-Piper''s intricate guitar work have never sounded better -- one wishes that they would have applied this aesthetic earlier in their career, as it complements their sound far better than the overly atmospheric production that''s marred them in the past. Momento Descuidado is both intimate and far-reaching, and for musicians who have made a career out of dreamy, reverb-drenched landscapes of long-winded murkiness and occasional beauty, that they''ve finally reduced these songs to the point of clarity is both triumphant and long overdue. <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Cooking Vinyl [COOKCD339]', NULL, 'CBR 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks+.cue,log,scans)', '55:20', '174 mb / 386 mb', 'https://fc.4crp.com/d/BriELb', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-02 20:19:24.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-02 17:19:24', '2018-08-03 05:19:50'),

Ave Africa [03:53]', '<!--QuoteEBegin-->Strut''s 2016 release Ave Africa collects the complete recorded works of Sunburst, a Tanzanian band influenced by several African traditions as well as Western music styles such as rock and funk. The group''s members were born in different countries and spoke different languages, and their music had a very diverse range, encompassing blues, soul, jazz, and Latin music. They originally formed in the early ''70s as a cover band, playing tunes by the likes of James Brown and Santana. As they began writing original compositions, their lyrics reflected themes of black pride, unity, and freedom, with titles such as "Black Is Beautiful" and "Enzi Za Utumwani" ("Slavery Days"). The group''s only full-length studio recording, Ave Africa, was actually recorded late in their career, and wasn''t released until 1977 as the band was breaking up. Despite having a few hit singles and being regarded as one of the nation''s best bands, they barely made any money and couldn''t afford to continue as a band. The songs on Ave Africa are as strong as they are diverse, with joyous, empowering numbers fitting alongside aching soul and blues ballads, and complex yet easily flowing full-band arrangements incorporating trombone, violin, and electric keyboards. Opening instrumental "Kitoto Sound" (the group''s description of their style) is bright and jubilant, with polyrhythmic percussion interacting with funky guitar licks, trombone, and organ. "Your Day Will Come" has a perky guitar line that comes close to sounding like ska, and the lyrics joyfully proclaim that "music makes you smile." However, the album''s production generally sounds muddled; there''s no bass, and everything seems cluttered together at the bottom of the mix with no room to breathe. The compilation''s second disc compiles the group''s singles (issued between 1973 and 1976 by Kenyan label Moto Moto and Tanzanian imprint TFC) as well as the 1973 Tanzanian radio session that launched the group to stardom. While these recordings understandably don''t have the highest fidelity, they''re more vibrant than the group''s studio album, with clearer sound and more adventurous production touches. Reverb adds a bit of depth to songs like "Kipato Sina," and the instruments (particularly the drums and keyboards) have much more of a sizzle to them. These sessions seem like a far greater representation of the group''s live powers. After listening to the entire collection and reading the liner notes, one can''t help but admire Sunburst; they had great songs and were incredible, versatile musicians. It seems like there was unrealized potential, however, so the collection suggests what could''ve been as much as it celebrates what the band accomplished. <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Strut [STRUT128CD]', NULL, '320 kbps / FLAC (tracks+.cue,log,scans)', '1:47:53', '260 mb / 511 mb', 'https://fc.4crp.com/d/OeMfmc', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-02 20:20:46.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-02 17:20:46', '2018-08-03 18:04:37'),

Eric Bromberger’s liner notes contextualize these works within the canon: “Some have claimed that Mozart invented the piano quartet, but he did not. Other composers- including the fourteen year old Beethoven- had written quartets for piano and strings earlier, but Mozart was the first to face squarely the challenges of this difficult form, and he wrote the first two great piano quartets.” Now in its 37th season, the Alexander String Quartet’s discography includes major cycles by Bartok, Kodaly, Mozart, Shostakovich, and Beethoven. ASQ is also an important advocate of new music, with over 35 commissions and premieres.

Recorded by the Berliner Blockfloten Orchester, Alla Turca makes audible not only the musical diversity of such Western representations of the Orient, but also the manifold timbral facets of the recorder. Well-known works such as Mozarts Rondo alla Turca stand alongside unfamiliar gems. Resplendent marches are contrasted with gentle Oriental idylls. Contemporary depictions are juxtaposed with Baroque perspectives. On their journey to the Orient, listeners encounter Jean-Baptiste Lully, Giuseppe Verdi, and Gioachino Rossini, as well as Julius Weissenborn, Ernest Richard Kroeger, and Reynaldo Hahn. Soren Siegs commissioned work Jabal Ram deserves special mention amongst this colourful company: it is the discs only piece that was written for a recorder orchestra. All other compositions were originally written for piano, organ, or even the bassoon, or formed part of stage works. With meticulous care, Simon Borutzki has arranged these works for recorders. His bespoke arrangements enable the Berliner Blockfloten Orchester to present the diversity of recorder music to full effect ranging from soft heights to unexpectedly warm depths. The orchestras sound is enriched by percussionist Nora Thiele. In some cases, her performances are improvised responses to a given works atmosphere, offering the ideal complement to the Oriental marches and dances of Alla Turca. <br><br>Berliner Blockflöten Orchester<br>Simon Borutzki, direction<br>Nora Thiele, percussion<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Klanglogo', NULL, '24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks+booklet)', '58:19', '538 MB', 'https://fc.4crp.com/d/THPSz', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-02 20:21:01.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-02 17:21:01', '2018-08-03 18:28:01'),

Possibly it was the high regard in which he held the genre that for so long stopped him from actually completing a quartet of his own – although he had first seriously considered writing one in 1828, it took almost 15 years before he was ready to fully commit to the idea. Once he had done so, there was no returning: during some hectic summer weeks in 1842, a year which is often called ‘Schumann''s chamber music year’, he completed the three string quartets of his Op. 41, presenting them to his wife Clara on her 23rd birthday in September. In her diary she wrote ‘… they delighted me to the utmost. Everything in them is new, clear, expertly worked out and always idiomatic.’ <br><br>The Op.41 quartets were to be the only ones from Schumann''s pen, but this is not to suggest that he was dissatisfied with them: in 1847 he wrote to his publisher that he regarded the quartets ‘as my best work from earlier times’. They are here performed by the Norwegian Engegård Quartet, whose latest release on BIS, of quartets by Grieg and Sibelius, has received critical acclaim, for instance in Gramophone: ‘Those seeking the Grieg/Sibelius pairing in modern sound would be hard pressed to find better.’ <br><br>Schumann gave the three quartets to Clara for her 23rd birthday on 13th September 1842. In the couple’s shared diary she noted: ‘The gift of his three quartets – which he arranged to be performed for me... that very evening... – brought me the greatest joy. About the quartets, all I can say is that they delighted me to the utmost. Everything in them is new, clear, expertly worked out and always idiomatic.’ The fact that Schumann wrote no more string quartets does not indicate that he was dissatisfied with them: in 1847 he wrote to his publisher Härtel that he still regarded the quartets ‘as my best work from earlier times’. And posterity has unanimously shared the view of the eminent Viennese critic Eduard Hanslick that the three Op. 41 quartets ‘are among the all-time jewels of chamber music’.

Their first CD for Sony Classical Switzerland entitled ‘Landscapes’ featuring works of Ernst Bloch has been awarded the „ECHO KLASSIK 2012“. In 2013 they‘ve been given the prize for cultural promotion by the canton Zurich. Their last album for Sony Classical with Debussy’s string quartet has been praised internationally.<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Sony Classical', NULL, 'FLAC (tracks) / 24bit FLAC soon...', '50:47', '288 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/668ws0fwanpz/Galatea_Quartet_-_Tango.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-03 07:15:10.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-03 04:15:10', '2018-08-03 04:15:10'),

He’s wildly poetic, especially when recounting his dedication to music, and the work that led to this particular collection of delicately passionate songs. “These things became the vehicle by which we traveled, giving us reason to spend most of our lives in a van of uncertainty.” <br><br>Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread is the follow up to 2016’s Mowing — the first record he released under his own name, after fronting psych folk projects Page France and Cotton Jones — June 2017’s Some Twist, and its extension, The Load EP. The sprawling new album was recorded in Benny Yurco’s one-bedroom apartment in downtown Burlington, Vermont. Nau and his collaborators had a cool little set up going in Yurco’s spot — drums and bass took over the bedroom, the guitar amp in the bathroom, Nau’s vocals and piano in the living room, and a vibraphone in the kitchen. It’s the first time one of Nau’s records happened all in one place, and it feels most like a band record than ever before, he says; Nau and this particular group of musicians held it down together as a true team, which is why Nau named the record in their honor. Nothing more was added to it than what was recorded by Nau and the band in Yurco’s apartment. It didn’t feel like the right thing to do to mess with it post-facto, he adds. “It’s a documented live performance. It happened the way it happened, and that’s how it is.” <br><br>You can hear that organicness all across Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread, from the golden-sounding, glibly existential love song “Less Than Positive,” one of the oldest written on album, to the smoky and melancholic “Smudge,” one of the most recent compositions. “It wasn’t until recently that I ever considered revisiting songs from so long ago,” Nau says of playing songs he wrote ages ago, like “Less Than Positive.” “But something happened where I’m now able to appreciate the distance between those songs written long ago, and where I’m at now. It feels like playing someone else’s song.” Nau stresses this theme of time and distance in talking about the record. And those metaphysical thoughts permeate the music, which hangs in an ageless space, somehow classic-sounding and fresh like a cold wind, at the same time. <br><br>The songs on this layered record sound sunny and familiar, like sharing stories and worries with a close friend on a late summer day. In a gorgeous and natural way, he contemplates his own process, those feelings of uncertainty. “Making it too hard just comes easier,” Nau croons on “Funny In Real Life,” an exquisite meditation on creation and self. “Truth is such a beautiful force/And every time we find the chorus/There’s no second-guessing the real/I don’t ever know how I feel.” <br><br>Nau shines when he’s nestled in that medium between melancholy and carefree. He seems to be thinking about the past, present, and future, all at the same time, and his songs move between pain and joy, fires and rivers, faraway stars, icy Saturdays, clouds of smoke, between shelter and flowers in the rain. “And it just keeps going, if it’s done it’s done/Still flow in the flowing, all around the sun,” he sings on “Smudge,” the record’s finale, which is about love, and memories, and loneliness, and apprehension — “Something coming around some bend/Waiting for something to never end” — all at once. It’s all just part of the waves of life; sometimes you get stuck, or things move slower, and sometimes the pace steps up. And that seems to be the gist of Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread — that there are “different movements” in the self, that constantly figuring yourself out is all part of the journey. “As long as love is the motion,” Nau says, “it might get there.” Wherever there is. <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Full Time Hobby', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit FLAC to soon...', '40:44', '95.8 / 238 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/d8psjo8srsus/Michael_Nau_and_the_Mighty_Thread_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-03 07:15:44.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-03 04:15:44', '2018-08-03 04:15:44'),

Guitarist and lead vocalist Jeremy Stephens, fiddle player Corrina Rose Logston Stephens, and banjo player Kurt Stephenson assembled a list of decades-old songs that they could flawlessly recreate on stage, including some gems from the Stanley Brothers. Before long, the band  which would soon expand to include Vickie Vaughn on bass and Daniel Amick on mandolin  realized they could put their own stamp on the material without losing the integrity of the original recording. With that newfound perspective, High Fidelity handily won that year''s contest.<br><br>To all but the most dyed-in-the-wool bluegrass and old-time music devotees, the music on High Fidelity''s Rebel Records debut ''Hills And Home'' will come as a revelation. The group avoids the well-known war horses associated with the likes of the Flatts &amp; Scruggses, the Stanleys and the Monroes. The band also mines gems from lesser known  but no less worthy  acts such as the Lilly Brothers &amp; Don Stover, Wade Mainer, Jim &amp; Jesse, and the Country Gentlemen.<br><br>High Fidelity wooed fans and industry professionals alike when they mounted the stage of last year''s International Bluegrass Music Association showcase.

Comprised of brothers Collin and Kyle Rausch and best friends Konnor Ervin, Kyle Little and Ross Brown, Shy Boys are the heartland’s answer to The Beach Boys had Alex Chilton been on guitar. <br><br>But if a harmony falls into a microphone in the middle of America does anyone really hear it? Some do. Take for instance Shy Boys’ 2014 self-titled debut on local Kansas City label, High Dive Records - I first came across this album while living in Los Angeles and catching wind of a band from my home town that I was told could "actually sing," and after the first spin, through the muddy fidelity, man, could they actually sing. <br><br>Shy Boys’ history isn''t too dissimilar from any other Midwestern band. Like the many Replacements or Husker Düs before them - they exist neither here nor there, but instead, somewhere anonymously in the middle. And though you may not find the same opportunity floating in the middle as one would Here or There, you are allotted a certain amount of time and space to grow both yourself and your craft into what you want it to be. Over the past four years, that is exactly what Shy Boys have done and that is what brings us here today. <br><br>On August 3, 2018, the world will see the release of their second record, Bell House, out on legendary and globally cherished record label Polyvinyl, bringing both their profile and music to the surface for the first time. <br><br>The album’s title is taken from the band’s beloved headquarters - the old house on Bell Street in Kansas City where they lived together for the better part of 5 years. <br><br>“‘Lived’ is a loose term,” says lead songwriter Collin. “It was more like a bum den than anything else. There was a giant hole in the floor of the kitchen that had a piece of plywood over it. In the backyard, weeds got like 6 feet high in the summer. It was its own thriving biome. We lived in trash.” <br><br>Musically, Collin describes the songs on Bell House taking shape through “a group of guys trying to get through some sort of mutual identity crisis. The lifestyle became overwhelming and really seeped into the music.” <br><br>In the time since the release of ST, Collin saw himself falling in love and getting married, leaving the old house on Bell Street, and moving back into his mom’s house with his wife in a suburb of the city. It''s here where the songs of Bell House were born. Being back under the same roof he had grown up in where there was “still writing on the walls from childhood," Rausch found himself reflective and looking out at his life as a whole. <br><br>Take closing track “Champion” for instance, a song Collin says is dedicated to his and Kyle’s mother. “It’s just a note saying that she took care of us when we were young, and now it’s time for us to be there and take care of her.” <br><br>The reflective spirit sprinkled throughout the album is also evident on lead single, “Take The Doggie,” a bouncy, guitar driven track centered around wanting to secretly rescue their neighbor’s dog from an abusive owner, or on album highlight “Evil Sin,” which tackles the memory of drummer/bassist Konnor Ervin getting robbed. <br><br>But through all of this, Rausch kept his passion in his band, if even for nothing more than to - in his own words - have an excuse to keep hanging out with his brother and best friends. <br><br>“I have to keep Shy Boys alive to have a regular excuse to hang out with them,” says Collin. “To keep the band alive, I have to write songs. To be able to travel with my buddies, there has to be a new record.” <br><br>There is an old term that''s kicked around in country music called a "blood harmony" - in which two people in the same blood line, usually siblings, harmonize with one another in real time. Perhaps that is Shy Boys’ magic touch, putting them just a notch above all the other angels out there in the indie rock choir, and it makes sense, though no longer practicing evangelicals, Collin and Kyle grew up singing besides their parents in their church choir, so their keen sense of harmony is nothing new to them, but instead a life practice devoted to the voice as an instrument. <br><br>The result is Bell House, and the result is beautiful. There is something sensitive to the touch about this album, which is perhaps another way of saying that, well - Shy Boys are indeed Shy Boys. I envision the band as a solid unit, with each moving part as an equal. There is a heavy sense of family in everything they do both, literally and figuratively. Bruce Springsteen''s 1980 song “Highway Patrolman” always seems to come to mind; <br><br>"Yeah me and Franky out laughing and drinking, <br>Nothing feels better than blood on blood." <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Polyvinyl Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit FLAC to soon...', '22:23', '53.7 / 136 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/i7b7g0rp1nj0/Shy_Boys_-_Bell_House_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-03 07:17:19.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-03 04:17:19', '2018-08-03 04:17:19'),

He began his professional career as a musician in 1967 when he was recruited to join The Tennors, a vocal group who had already scored a big hit with "Pressure And The Slide" on Coxsone''s Studio One label. The group scored another massive hit in 1968 with "Ride Your Donkey" with more hits following in 1973 when Ronnie led the group on "Weather Report" for Duke Reid''s Treasure Isle label and "Take Heed" for Bunny Lee. Both records sold well, and with encouragement from Bunny Lee, Ronnie left the group to pursue a solo career. During the mid-''70s Ronnie was among the most prolific of Jamaica''s vocalists, recording over 100 titles for a variety of labels and producers including a large body of work for Bunny Lee. By the late ''70s Davis was producing his own work for release on his own On Top label while continuing to work for other producers. He bonded with producer Lloyd Campbell who released some of Davis'' best work on the Spider Man label and included "Won''t You Come Home" which became a minor hit due in part to the superb rhythm track from The Revolutionaires. Ronnie loved this record, and soon returned to Lloyd Campbell with Keith Porter, a friend from Savannah La Mar who had written a new song for the rhythm. Together they cut "In A Dis A Time" with Keith leading the fierce Rastafarian classic with sweet harmony from Ronnie. The song, credited to The Itals, became a massive local hit. They added a third singer, Lloyd Ricketts, and Campbell and continued recording.

Gulp are on a journey, a state of perpetual transition. The band make mini Kraut-pop epics, informed equally by the sun flares of the Californian desert and the drizzle of pure, sweet Scottish rain and northern light. Debut album ‘Season Sun’ was a home-grown delight, a ramshackle, endlessly inventive selection of dreamy psychedelic nuggets to watch the world flash past.<br><br>New album ‘All Good Wishes’ half-inches its title from a vintage Scottish postcard, and it’s emblematic of the changes the pair have undergone. “I think all through making this record we were looking at relocating,” Guto explains. “Whereas the first record was more of a road trip this is possibly a bit more focussed on home, and focussed on where we’re from and where we’re looking to go to. It’s partly a farewell to Wales, and hello to Scotland.”<br><br>The record was largely built in South Wales, a three-year process that saw the band retreat to their basement for endless sonic incisions and revisions. A broader, wider, perhaps bolder experience than their debut, ‘All Good Wishes’ is rooted in fantastic pop songwriting, in creating three minute vignettes that express complex ideas in a simple, accessible, endlessly fascinating way. Endlessly restrained yet infinitely open, each Gulp track is like a world in miniature, ideas borrowed from Krautrock and electronic culture slimmed down into these infinitely enjoyable pop songs.<br><br>Minimalist Kraut-pop with a dreamy, Cocteau Twins esque vibe, recent single ‘Morning Velvet Sky’ was a potent introduction to the duo’s ever-shifting realm. Following on from introductory cut ‘Search For Your Love’ - released on Tim Burgess’ esteemed O Genesis label - ‘Morning Velvet Sky’ was mixed by Luke Abbott, and the producer cast his eye over the record as a whole during the final mixdown in his home studio in Norwich<br><br>From Cardiff to Norwich and onwards to the Scottish East Coast, Gulp are tracing sonic ley-lines, empowering themselves, plugging into often over-looked artistic communities to fuel their next move. “We spent a lot of time on road trips listening to music, experiencing and enjoying different landscapes” he explains. “It’s especially apt in these times to see the good side of human nature; despite what the media portrays, people are generally sound, and it’s great be reminded of that in day-to-day living.<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'E.L.K.

Rollin'' With the Flow', '<!--QuoteEBegin-->Four years after releasing their Merge debut, Frozen Letter, Spider Bags have returned with Someday Everything Will Be Fine, an LP that ascends to new levels of aural punch and perspective. The years that elapsed between records were crucial in enabling that progress to take place. “We had gone as far as we could go with touring all the time, and cranking out singles and our own records,” says frontman Dan McGee, reflecting on the prolific touring and recording pace he and his bandmates have kept up since 2007. “I really wanted to see what would happen if we were just concentrating on material instead of preparing for shows. We were really able to focus on maybe 12, 14 songs—knowing we were going to have to bring them down to 10—and I think it’s a better record for it. We rehearsed ‘My Heart Is a Flame in Reverse’ and ‘Reckless’ for a year before we recorded them. That’s not something we’ve ever had the time to do before.” Recorded in Memphis at Bunker Audio by Andrew McCalla (who also engineered Spider Bags’ seminal 2012 rock and roll party record Shake my Head), Someday Everything Will Be Fine leverages the limitations and glory of the Tascam 388, a vintage recording/mixing device that’s acquired a mythos via its association with legendary records by Dinosaur Jr., East River Pipe, the Black Keys, Ty Segall, and Thee Oh Sees to name a few. The Tascam’s charms are more immediate, with a visceral resonance all its own. “It’s an 8-track machine designed for smaller studios, so your eight tracks are on quarter-inch tape. It squashes the tracks so close together they bleed into each other, which, you know, shouldn’t work, but it does. There’s also a certain compression that happens on those machines that cannot be duplicated. It feels live, but it also sounds like it took place in a studio. It’s not about being an analog purist—it’s about finding the medium that works best for what you’re trying to create, and the band has never sounded better than we sound on this record. I wanted to do as much as we could live, the four of us together playing the guitar solos and tripping effects on the fly like we would at a show. I wanted to capture the performance without the use of infinite tracks and the ability to click away mistakes. You have to be well rehearsed to make a record that way. The album is almost entirely first takes. ‘Burning Sand’ is not only a first take but also the first time we played the song all the way through, with a minute-long instrumental opening that was completely off the cuff. That’s how my favorite rock and roll records were made. It’s the limitations, I think, that create the performance.” Recording in Memphis also lent its own mojo to the album’s sound and feel. According to McGee, “Rock and roll just sounds better there. I swear.” Adding to this sound is the featured playing of Memphis giants Jack Oblivian, John Whittemore, Jana Misener and Krista Wroten-Combest of the Memphis Dawls, and multi-instrumentalist Seth Moody. “It’s a great town with so much individuality and history, musical and otherwise, that can’t help but seep into the music you’re making. I love that city.” Other non-Spider Bag contributing musicians include Patrick Stickles of Titus Andronicus and Matthew Hoopengardner of Austin, Texas, rock and roll legends the Golden Boys. The LP opens with “Reckless,” a strangely organic-sounding sprawl wrought from different parts of songs that McGee had struggled to complete, which peaks with gorgeous guitar fireworks. “The song didn’t seem satisfied until I brought in a couple pieces from other songs I hadn’t finished,” says McGee. “Steve [Oliva, the band’s bassist] said when we finished recording it, ‘There’s seven parts in that song and none of them repeat.’” From that epic build-up, the record returns to earth with the sprightly “Oxcart Blues,” whose twinned guitars a...<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Merge Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit FLAC to soon...', '38:27', '105 / 239 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/yq4oc2qa2uj9/Someday_Everything_Will_Be_Fine_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-03 07:18:42.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-03 04:18:42', '2018-08-03 04:18:42'),

To me, that roughly means "the stuff from which stuff generates." It''s a short hand way of evoking all the elements that I''m mashing up in this music. The idea is basically that it''s this collision of genres, and collision of different versions of "American music." It''s also an album that doesn''t fit very neatly into a category of album — studio? live? remix? Maybe all, or none, of the above. This is a new mutant variety of Elephant Micah, better suited to survive the cultural climate of the moment in so-called "Trump''s America." It lives! I guess the lodestone in the process of making this was the kind of global avant garde mood that''s prevalent in a lot of 1980s albums I admire. Things like Joni Mitchell''s Dog Eat Dog and Arthur Russell''s Calling Out of Context. These records where singers were making really eclectic and outward looking productions — writing *through* the process of recording, and literally *play- ing* with technologies that were totally new to them. All the gear that I gathered to make the album was basically discarded or devalued. I got a bunch of stuff from Craigslist that interested me: a cheap FM synth, some Hindustani electronics, and an old three-head tape deck to use as a "poor man''s space echo." The icing on the cake is a one-of-a-kind home- made digital synthesizer called "The Mutant". I worked with my brother to design it. He built it and coded it. The concept of the synth is parallel to the concept of the album itself. It''s an electronic take on "folk" sounds (bends, drones, modal playing) and folk creative approaches (a cobbling together and reformatting of existing elements).<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Western Vinyl', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit FLAC to soon...', '32:07', '74.6 / 136 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/n1k81xrhxhpn/Elephant_Micah_-_Genericana_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-03 07:18:47.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-03 04:18:47', '2018-08-03 04:18:47'),

Schubert began this composition in August 1824, or possibly even as late as March 1825. Most of the work on it took place in the summer of 1825, during the longest journey of his life. It took him from Vienna via Linz, Steyr, Gmunden (where he found the scenery "truly heavenly"), Salzburg and then up to Bad Gastein, where he saw some magnificent alpine peaks. The first page of the score manuscript is dated "March 1828" – possibly the month in which he finally completed the work. On November 19 of that same year, Schubert died at the age of only thirty-one. The symphony was premiered posthumously on March 21, 1839 in the Leipzig Gewandhaus, and conducted by the Gewandhaus Kapellmeister at that time - the 30-year-old Felix Mendelssohn. This is a star-studded and outstanding interpretation of one of the most important compositions of the Romantic symphonic repertoire. <br><br>Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks<br>Mariss Jansons, conductor <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'BR-Klassik', NULL, 'FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks+booklet)', '60:18', '271 / 565 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/h1x9vshm0m2e/Schubert_Symphony_No_9_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-03 20:15:24.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-03 17:15:24', '2018-08-03 17:15:24'),

Possibly it was the high regard in which he held the genre that for so long stopped him from actually completing a quartet of his own – although he had first seriously considered writing one in 1828, it took almost 15 years before he was ready to fully commit to the idea. Once he had done so, there was no returning: during some hectic summer weeks in 1842, a year which is often called ‘Schumann''s chamber music year’, he completed the three string quartets of his Op. 41, presenting them to his wife Clara on her 23rd birthday in September. In her diary she wrote ‘… they delighted me to the utmost. Everything in them is new, clear, expertly worked out and always idiomatic.’ <br><br>The Op.41 quartets were to be the only ones from Schumann''s pen, but this is not to suggest that he was dissatisfied with them: in 1847 he wrote to his publisher that he regarded the quartets ‘as my best work from earlier times’. They are here performed by the Norwegian Engegård Quartet, whose latest release on BIS, of quartets by Grieg and Sibelius, has received critical acclaim, for instance in Gramophone: ‘Those seeking the Grieg/Sibelius pairing in modern sound would be hard pressed to find better.’ <br><br>Schumann gave the three quartets to Clara for her 23rd birthday on 13th September 1842. In the couple’s shared diary she noted: ‘The gift of his three quartets – which he arranged to be performed for me... that very evening... – brought me the greatest joy. About the quartets, all I can say is that they delighted me to the utmost. Everything in them is new, clear, expertly worked out and always idiomatic.’ The fact that Schumann wrote no more string quartets does not indicate that he was dissatisfied with them: in 1847 he wrote to his publisher Härtel that he still regarded the quartets ‘as my best work from earlier times’. And posterity has unanimously shared the view of the eminent Viennese critic Eduard Hanslick that the three Op. 41 quartets ‘are among the all-time jewels of chamber music’.

He’s wildly poetic, especially when recounting his dedication to music, and the work that led to this particular collection of delicately passionate songs. “These things became the vehicle by which we traveled, giving us reason to spend most of our lives in a van of uncertainty.” <br><br>Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread is the follow up to 2016’s Mowing — the first record he released under his own name, after fronting psych folk projects Page France and Cotton Jones — June 2017’s Some Twist, and its extension, The Load EP. The sprawling new album was recorded in Benny Yurco’s one-bedroom apartment in downtown Burlington, Vermont. Nau and his collaborators had a cool little set up going in Yurco’s spot — drums and bass took over the bedroom, the guitar amp in the bathroom, Nau’s vocals and piano in the living room, and a vibraphone in the kitchen. It’s the first time one of Nau’s records happened all in one place, and it feels most like a band record than ever before, he says; Nau and this particular group of musicians held it down together as a true team, which is why Nau named the record in their honor. Nothing more was added to it than what was recorded by Nau and the band in Yurco’s apartment. It didn’t feel like the right thing to do to mess with it post-facto, he adds. “It’s a documented live performance. It happened the way it happened, and that’s how it is.” <br><br>You can hear that organicness all across Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread, from the golden-sounding, glibly existential love song “Less Than Positive,” one of the oldest written on album, to the smoky and melancholic “Smudge,” one of the most recent compositions. “It wasn’t until recently that I ever considered revisiting songs from so long ago,” Nau says of playing songs he wrote ages ago, like “Less Than Positive.” “But something happened where I’m now able to appreciate the distance between those songs written long ago, and where I’m at now. It feels like playing someone else’s song.” Nau stresses this theme of time and distance in talking about the record. And those metaphysical thoughts permeate the music, which hangs in an ageless space, somehow classic-sounding and fresh like a cold wind, at the same time. <br><br>The songs on this layered record sound sunny and familiar, like sharing stories and worries with a close friend on a late summer day. In a gorgeous and natural way, he contemplates his own process, those feelings of uncertainty. “Making it too hard just comes easier,” Nau croons on “Funny In Real Life,” an exquisite meditation on creation and self. “Truth is such a beautiful force/And every time we find the chorus/There’s no second-guessing the real/I don’t ever know how I feel.” <br><br>Nau shines when he’s nestled in that medium between melancholy and carefree. He seems to be thinking about the past, present, and future, all at the same time, and his songs move between pain and joy, fires and rivers, faraway stars, icy Saturdays, clouds of smoke, between shelter and flowers in the rain. “And it just keeps going, if it’s done it’s done/Still flow in the flowing, all around the sun,” he sings on “Smudge,” the record’s finale, which is about love, and memories, and loneliness, and apprehension — “Something coming around some bend/Waiting for something to never end” — all at once. It’s all just part of the waves of life; sometimes you get stuck, or things move slower, and sometimes the pace steps up. And that seems to be the gist of Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread — that there are “different movements” in the self, that constantly figuring yourself out is all part of the journey. “As long as love is the motion,” Nau says, “it might get there.” Wherever there is. <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Full Time Hobby', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks)', '40:44', '95.8 / 238 / 436 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/plcnv59i4uzg/Michael_Nau_and_the_Mighty_Thread_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-03 20:18:16.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-03 17:18:16', '2018-08-03 17:18:16'),

Guitarist and lead vocalist Jeremy Stephens, fiddle player Corrina Rose Logston Stephens, and banjo player Kurt Stephenson assembled a list of decades-old songs that they could flawlessly recreate on stage, including some gems from the Stanley Brothers. Before long, the band  which would soon expand to include Vickie Vaughn on bass and Daniel Amick on mandolin  realized they could put their own stamp on the material without losing the integrity of the original recording. With that newfound perspective, High Fidelity handily won that year''s contest.<br><br>To all but the most dyed-in-the-wool bluegrass and old-time music devotees, the music on High Fidelity''s Rebel Records debut ''Hills And Home'' will come as a revelation.

The band also mines gems from lesser known  but no less worthy  acts such as the Lilly Brothers &amp; Don Stover, Wade Mainer, Jim &amp; Jesse, and the Country Gentlemen.<br><br>High Fidelity wooed fans and industry professionals alike when they mounted the stage of last year''s International Bluegrass Music Association showcase.

Comprised of brothers Collin and Kyle Rausch and best friends Konnor Ervin, Kyle Little and Ross Brown, Shy Boys are the heartland’s answer to The Beach Boys had Alex Chilton been on guitar. <br><br>But if a harmony falls into a microphone in the middle of America does anyone really hear it? Some do. Take for instance Shy Boys’ 2014 self-titled debut on local Kansas City label, High Dive Records - I first came across this album while living in Los Angeles and catching wind of a band from my home town that I was told could "actually sing," and after the first spin, through the muddy fidelity, man, could they actually sing. <br><br>Shy Boys’ history isn''t too dissimilar from any other Midwestern band. Like the many Replacements or Husker Düs before them - they exist neither here nor there, but instead, somewhere anonymously in the middle. And though you may not find the same opportunity floating in the middle as one would Here or There, you are allotted a certain amount of time and space to grow both yourself and your craft into what you want it to be. Over the past four years, that is exactly what Shy Boys have done and that is what brings us here today. <br><br>On August 3, 2018, the world will see the release of their second record, Bell House, out on legendary and globally cherished record label Polyvinyl, bringing both their profile and music to the surface for the first time. <br><br>The album’s title is taken from the band’s beloved headquarters - the old house on Bell Street in Kansas City where they lived together for the better part of 5 years. <br><br>“‘Lived’ is a loose term,” says lead songwriter Collin. “It was more like a bum den than anything else. There was a giant hole in the floor of the kitchen that had a piece of plywood over it. In the backyard, weeds got like 6 feet high in the summer. It was its own thriving biome. We lived in trash.” <br><br>Musically, Collin describes the songs on Bell House taking shape through “a group of guys trying to get through some sort of mutual identity crisis. The lifestyle became overwhelming and really seeped into the music.” <br><br>In the time since the release of ST, Collin saw himself falling in love and getting married, leaving the old house on Bell Street, and moving back into his mom’s house with his wife in a suburb of the city. It''s here where the songs of Bell House were born. Being back under the same roof he had grown up in where there was “still writing on the walls from childhood," Rausch found himself reflective and looking out at his life as a whole. <br><br>Take closing track “Champion” for instance, a song Collin says is dedicated to his and Kyle’s mother. “It’s just a note saying that she took care of us when we were young, and now it’s time for us to be there and take care of her.” <br><br>The reflective spirit sprinkled throughout the album is also evident on lead single, “Take The Doggie,” a bouncy, guitar driven track centered around wanting to secretly rescue their neighbor’s dog from an abusive owner, or on album highlight “Evil Sin,” which tackles the memory of drummer/bassist Konnor Ervin getting robbed. <br><br>But through all of this, Rausch kept his passion in his band, if even for nothing more than to - in his own words - have an excuse to keep hanging out with his brother and best friends. <br><br>“I have to keep Shy Boys alive to have a regular excuse to hang out with them,” says Collin. “To keep the band alive, I have to write songs. To be able to travel with my buddies, there has to be a new record.” <br><br>There is an old term that''s kicked around in country music called a "blood harmony" - in which two people in the same blood line, usually siblings, harmonize with one another in real time. Perhaps that is Shy Boys’ magic touch, putting them just a notch above all the other angels out there in the indie rock choir, and it makes sense, though no longer practicing evangelicals, Collin and Kyle grew up singing besides their parents in their church choir, so their keen sense of harmony is nothing new to them, but instead a life practice devoted to the voice as an instrument. <br><br>The result is Bell House, and the result is beautiful. There is something sensitive to the touch about this album, which is perhaps another way of saying that, well - Shy Boys are indeed Shy Boys. I envision the band as a solid unit, with each moving part as an equal. There is a heavy sense of family in everything they do both, literally and figuratively. Bruce Springsteen''s 1980 song “Highway Patrolman” always seems to come to mind; <br><br>"Yeah me and Franky out laughing and drinking, <br>Nothing feels better than blood on blood." <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Polyvinyl Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks)', '22:23', '53.7 / 136 / 247 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/3nyji7ju6uir/Shy_Boys_-_Bell_House_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-03 20:19:52.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-03 17:19:52', '2018-08-03 17:19:52'),

He began his professional career as a musician in 1967 when he was recruited to join The Tennors, a vocal group who had already scored a big hit with "Pressure And The Slide" on Coxsone''s Studio One label. The group scored another massive hit in 1968 with "Ride Your Donkey" with more hits following in 1973 when Ronnie led the group on "Weather Report" for Duke Reid''s Treasure Isle label and "Take Heed" for Bunny Lee. Both records sold well, and with encouragement from Bunny Lee, Ronnie left the group to pursue a solo career. During the mid-''70s Ronnie was among the most prolific of Jamaica''s vocalists, recording over 100 titles for a variety of labels and producers including a large body of work for Bunny Lee. By the late ''70s Davis was producing his own work for release on his own On Top label while continuing to work for other producers. He bonded with producer Lloyd Campbell who released some of Davis'' best work on the Spider Man label and included "Won''t You Come Home" which became a minor hit due in part to the superb rhythm track from The Revolutionaires. Ronnie loved this record, and soon returned to Lloyd Campbell with Keith Porter, a friend from Savannah La Mar who had written a new song for the rhythm. Together they cut "In A Dis A Time" with Keith leading the fierce Rastafarian classic with sweet harmony from Ronnie. The song, credited to The Itals, became a massive local hit. They added a third singer, Lloyd Ricketts, and Campbell and continued recording. In late 1979, Robert Schoenfeld and Leroy Jodie Pierson of Nighthawk Records began searching for The Itals and after tracking them down, they found themselves gathered at Aquarius Studio listening to superb Spider Man tracks by the group. A few days later, Keith Porter, Lloyd Ricketts and Ronnie Davis auditioned songs for their very first album, Brutal Out Deh. The group was signed to a five-year contract and began work on their album. Robert Palmer wrote a rave review published in the weekend edition of the New York Times, and sales exploded. The Itals became one of the most successful touring reggae acts in the U.S. Their third album, Rasta Philosophy was among the five final nominations for the 1987 Best Reggae Album Grammy® award. In the 1980''s when the group splintered, Ronnie felt that he should create his own vocal group. He had never stopped recording as a solo artist and with the aid of long-established Savannah La Mar vocalists Lloyd Ricketts, Roy Smith and Robert Doctor, he recorded a new album Come Straight, released in 1996 credited to Ronnie Davis and Idren.

A few days later, Keith Porter, Lloyd Ricketts and Ronnie Davis auditioned songs for their very first album, Brutal Out Deh. The group was signed to a five-year contract and began work on their album. Robert Palmer wrote a rave review published in the weekend edition of the New York Times, and sales exploded. The Itals became one of the most successful touring reggae acts in the U.S. Their third album, Rasta Philosophy was among the five final nominations for the 1987 Best Reggae Album Grammy® award. In the 1980''s when the group splintered, Ronnie felt that he should create his own vocal group. He had never stopped recording as a solo artist and with the aid of long-established Savannah La Mar vocalists Lloyd Ricketts, Roy Smith and Robert Doctor, he recorded a new album Come Straight, released in 1996 credited to Ronnie Davis and Idren. Now remastered with two bonus tracks, new liner notes from Nighthawk''s Leroy Jodie Pierson and previously unseen photos, this acclaimed album has never sounded better!<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Omnivore Recordings', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks)', '63:44', '153 / 353 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/vxve1ejagr7r/Ronnie_Davis_And_Idren_-_Come_Straight_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-03 20:20:07.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-03 17:20:08', '2018-08-03 17:20:08'),

Gulp are on a journey, a state of perpetual transition. The band make mini Kraut-pop epics, informed equally by the sun flares of the Californian desert and the drizzle of pure, sweet Scottish rain and northern light. Debut album ‘Season Sun’ was a home-grown delight, a ramshackle, endlessly inventive selection of dreamy psychedelic nuggets to watch the world flash past.<br><br>New album ‘All Good Wishes’ half-inches its title from a vintage Scottish postcard, and it’s emblematic of the changes the pair have undergone. “I think all through making this record we were looking at relocating,” Guto explains. “Whereas the first record was more of a road trip this is possibly a bit more focussed on home, and focussed on where we’re from and where we’re looking to go to. It’s partly a farewell to Wales, and hello to Scotland.”<br><br>The record was largely built in South Wales, a three-year process that saw the band retreat to their basement for endless sonic incisions and revisions. A broader, wider, perhaps bolder experience than their debut, ‘All Good Wishes’ is rooted in fantastic pop songwriting, in creating three minute vignettes that express complex ideas in a simple, accessible, endlessly fascinating way. Endlessly restrained yet infinitely open, each Gulp track is like a world in miniature, ideas borrowed from Krautrock and electronic culture slimmed down into these infinitely enjoyable pop songs.<br><br>Minimalist Kraut-pop with a dreamy, Cocteau Twins esque vibe, recent single ‘Morning Velvet Sky’ was a potent introduction to the duo’s ever-shifting realm.

Rollin'' With the Flow', '<!--QuoteEBegin-->Four years after releasing their Merge debut, Frozen Letter, Spider Bags have returned with Someday Everything Will Be Fine, an LP that ascends to new levels of aural punch and perspective. The years that elapsed between records were crucial in enabling that progress to take place. “We had gone as far as we could go with touring all the time, and cranking out singles and our own records,” says frontman Dan McGee, reflecting on the prolific touring and recording pace he and his bandmates have kept up since 2007. “I really wanted to see what would happen if we were just concentrating on material instead of preparing for shows. We were really able to focus on maybe 12, 14 songs—knowing we were going to have to bring them down to 10—and I think it’s a better record for it. We rehearsed ‘My Heart Is a Flame in Reverse’ and ‘Reckless’ for a year before we recorded them. That’s not something we’ve ever had the time to do before.” Recorded in Memphis at Bunker Audio by Andrew McCalla (who also engineered Spider Bags’ seminal 2012 rock and roll party record Shake my Head), Someday Everything Will Be Fine leverages the limitations and glory of the Tascam 388, a vintage recording/mixing device that’s acquired a mythos via its association with legendary records by Dinosaur Jr., East River Pipe, the Black Keys, Ty Segall, and Thee Oh Sees to name a few. The Tascam’s charms are more immediate, with a visceral resonance all its own. “It’s an 8-track machine designed for smaller studios, so your eight tracks are on quarter-inch tape. It squashes the tracks so close together they bleed into each other, which, you know, shouldn’t work, but it does. There’s also a certain compression that happens on those machines that cannot be duplicated. It feels live, but it also sounds like it took place in a studio. It’s not about being an analog purist—it’s about finding the medium that works best for what you’re trying to create, and the band has never sounded better than we sound on this record. I wanted to do as much as we could live, the four of us together playing the guitar solos and tripping effects on the fly like we would at a show. I wanted to capture the performance without the use of infinite tracks and the ability to click away mistakes. You have to be well rehearsed to make a record that way. The album is almost entirely first takes. ‘Burning Sand’ is not only a first take but also the first time we played the song all the way through, with a minute-long instrumental opening that was completely off the cuff. That’s how my favorite rock and roll records were made. It’s the limitations, I think, that create the performance.” Recording in Memphis also lent its own mojo to the album’s sound and feel. According to McGee, “Rock and roll just sounds better there. I swear.” Adding to this sound is the featured playing of Memphis giants Jack Oblivian, John Whittemore, Jana Misener and Krista Wroten-Combest of the Memphis Dawls, and multi-instrumentalist Seth Moody. “It’s a great town with so much individuality and history, musical and otherwise, that can’t help but seep into the music you’re making. I love that city.” Other non-Spider Bag contributing musicians include Patrick Stickles of Titus Andronicus and Matthew Hoopengardner of Austin, Texas, rock and roll legends the Golden Boys. The LP opens with “Reckless,” a strangely organic-sounding sprawl wrought from different parts of songs that McGee had struggled to complete, which peaks with gorgeous guitar fireworks. “The song didn’t seem satisfied until I brought in a couple pieces from other songs I hadn’t finished,” says McGee. “Steve [Oliva, the band’s bassist] said when we finished recording it, ‘There’s seven parts in that song and none of them repeat.’” From that epic build-up, the record returns to earth with the sprightly “Oxcart Blues,” whose twinned guitars a...<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Merge Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-48kHz FLAC (tracks)', '38:27', '105 / 239 / 449 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/j9srnvv9hwu5/Someday_Everything_Will_Be_Fine_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-03 20:21:16.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-03 17:21:16', '2018-08-03 17:21:16'),

To me, that roughly means "the stuff from which stuff generates." It''s a short hand way of evoking all the elements that I''m mashing up in this music. The idea is basically that it''s this collision of genres, and collision of different versions of "American music." It''s also an album that doesn''t fit very neatly into a category of album — studio? live? remix? Maybe all, or none, of the above. This is a new mutant variety of Elephant Micah, better suited to survive the cultural climate of the moment in so-called "Trump''s America." It lives! I guess the lodestone in the process of making this was the kind of global avant garde mood that''s prevalent in a lot of 1980s albums I admire. Things like Joni Mitchell''s Dog Eat Dog and Arthur Russell''s Calling Out of Context. These records where singers were making really eclectic and outward looking productions — writing *through* the process of recording, and literally *play- ing* with technologies that were totally new to them. All the gear that I gathered to make the album was basically discarded or devalued. I got a bunch of stuff from Craigslist that interested me: a cheap FM synth, some Hindustani electronics, and an old three-head tape deck to use as a "poor man''s space echo." The icing on the cake is a one-of-a-kind home- made digital synthesizer called "The Mutant". I worked with my brother to design it. He built it and coded it. The concept of the synth is parallel to the concept of the album itself. It''s an electronic take on "folk" sounds (bends, drones, modal playing) and folk creative approaches (a cobbling together and reformatting of existing elements).<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Western Vinyl', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks)', '32:07', '74.6 / 136 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/n1k81xrhxhpn/Elephant_Micah_-_Genericana_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-03 20:21:22.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-03 17:21:22', '2018-08-03 17:21:22'),

Schubert began this composition in August 1824, or possibly even as late as March 1825. Most of the work on it took place in the summer of 1825, during the longest journey of his life. It took him from Vienna via Linz, Steyr, Gmunden (where he found the scenery "truly heavenly"), Salzburg and then up to Bad Gastein, where he saw some magnificent alpine peaks. The first page of the score manuscript is dated "March 1828" – possibly the month in which he finally completed the work. On November 19 of that same year, Schubert died at the age of only thirty-one. The symphony was premiered posthumously on March 21, 1839 in the Leipzig Gewandhaus, and conducted by the Gewandhaus Kapellmeister at that time - the 30-year-old Felix Mendelssohn.

Possibly it was the high regard in which he held the genre that for so long stopped him from actually completing a quartet of his own – although he had first seriously considered writing one in 1828, it took almost 15 years before he was ready to fully commit to the idea. Once he had done so, there was no returning: during some hectic summer weeks in 1842, a year which is often called ‘Schumann''s chamber music year’, he completed the three string quartets of his Op. 41, presenting them to his wife Clara on her 23rd birthday in September. In her diary she wrote ‘… they delighted me to the utmost. Everything in them is new, clear, expertly worked out and always idiomatic.’ <br><br>The Op.41 quartets were to be the only ones from Schumann''s pen, but this is not to suggest that he was dissatisfied with them: in 1847 he wrote to his publisher that he regarded the quartets ‘as my best work from earlier times’. They are here performed by the Norwegian Engegård Quartet, whose latest release on BIS, of quartets by Grieg and Sibelius, has received critical acclaim, for instance in Gramophone: ‘Those seeking the Grieg/Sibelius pairing in modern sound would be hard pressed to find better.’ <br><br>Schumann gave the three quartets to Clara for her 23rd birthday on 13th September 1842. In the couple’s shared diary she noted: ‘The gift of his three quartets – which he arranged to be performed for me... that very evening... – brought me the greatest joy. About the quartets, all I can say is that they delighted me to the utmost. Everything in them is new, clear, expertly worked out and always idiomatic.’ The fact that Schumann wrote no more string quartets does not indicate that he was dissatisfied with them: in 1847 he wrote to his publisher Härtel that he still regarded the quartets ‘as my best work from earlier times’. And posterity has unanimously shared the view of the eminent Viennese critic Eduard Hanslick that the three Op. 41 quartets ‘are among the all-time jewels of chamber music’.

Short is accompanied by the Orchestre Philharmonique de Marseille, led by its Music Director Lawrence Foster. <br><br>Kevin Short, bass-baritone<br>Orchestre Philharmonique de Marseille<br>Lawrence Foster, conductor <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'PentaTone', NULL, 'FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-96kHz FLAC (tracks+booklet)', '57:01', '268 MB / 1.03 GB', 'https://isra.cloud/je2j4ao94906/Mephistopheles_and_Other_Bad_Guys_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-04 20:16:43.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-04 17:16:43', '2018-08-04 17:16:43'),

They’re founders of “plez rock”, a music genre based on pleasantness and feeling good. It’s cute, and maybe a bit cheeky, but it’s dead on. Falcon Jane’s songs convey depth and lightness in equal measure, and they’re a joy to listen to. In short, it’s absolutely pleasant rock.<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Darling Recordings', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks)', '34:08', '79.7 / 210 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/agjlz3g2kacd/Falcon_Jane_-_Feelin_Freaky_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-04 20:18:07.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-04 17:18:07', '2018-08-04 17:18:07'),

He’s wildly poetic, especially when recounting his dedication to music, and the work that led to this particular collection of delicately passionate songs. “These things became the vehicle by which we traveled, giving us reason to spend most of our lives in a van of uncertainty.” <br><br>Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread is the follow up to 2016’s Mowing — the first record he released under his own name, after fronting psych folk projects Page France and Cotton Jones — June 2017’s Some Twist, and its extension, The Load EP. The sprawling new album was recorded in Benny Yurco’s one-bedroom apartment in downtown Burlington, Vermont. Nau and his collaborators had a cool little set up going in Yurco’s spot — drums and bass took over the bedroom, the guitar amp in the bathroom, Nau’s vocals and piano in the living room, and a vibraphone in the kitchen. It’s the first time one of Nau’s records happened all in one place, and it feels most like a band record than ever before, he says; Nau and this particular group of musicians held it down together as a true team, which is why Nau named the record in their honor. Nothing more was added to it than what was recorded by Nau and the band in Yurco’s apartment. It didn’t feel like the right thing to do to mess with it post-facto, he adds. “It’s a documented live performance. It happened the way it happened, and that’s how it is.” <br><br>You can hear that organicness all across Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread, from the golden-sounding, glibly existential love song “Less Than Positive,” one of the oldest written on album, to the smoky and melancholic “Smudge,” one of the most recent compositions. “It wasn’t until recently that I ever considered revisiting songs from so long ago,” Nau says of playing songs he wrote ages ago, like “Less Than Positive.” “But something happened where I’m now able to appreciate the distance between those songs written long ago, and where I’m at now. It feels like playing someone else’s song.” Nau stresses this theme of time and distance in talking about the record. And those metaphysical thoughts permeate the music, which hangs in an ageless space, somehow classic-sounding and fresh like a cold wind, at the same time. <br><br>The songs on this layered record sound sunny and familiar, like sharing stories and worries with a close friend on a late summer day. In a gorgeous and natural way, he contemplates his own process, those feelings of uncertainty. “Making it too hard just comes easier,” Nau croons on “Funny In Real Life,” an exquisite meditation on creation and self. “Truth is such a beautiful force/And every time we find the chorus/There’s no second-guessing the real/I don’t ever know how I feel.” <br><br>Nau shines when he’s nestled in that medium between melancholy and carefree. He seems to be thinking about the past, present, and future, all at the same time, and his songs move between pain and joy, fires and rivers, faraway stars, icy Saturdays, clouds of smoke, between shelter and flowers in the rain. “And it just keeps going, if it’s done it’s done/Still flow in the flowing, all around the sun,” he sings on “Smudge,” the record’s finale, which is about love, and memories, and loneliness, and apprehension — “Something coming around some bend/Waiting for something to never end” — all at once. It’s all just part of the waves of life; sometimes you get stuck, or things move slower, and sometimes the pace steps up. And that seems to be the gist of Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread — that there are “different movements” in the self, that constantly figuring yourself out is all part of the journey. “As long as love is the motion,” Nau says, “it might get there.” Wherever there is. <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Full Time Hobby', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks)', '40:44', '95.8 / 238 / 436 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/plcnv59i4uzg/Michael_Nau_and_the_Mighty_Thread_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-04 20:18:15.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-04 17:18:15', '2018-08-04 17:18:15'),

Comprised of brothers Collin and Kyle Rausch and best friends Konnor Ervin, Kyle Little and Ross Brown, Shy Boys are the heartland’s answer to The Beach Boys had Alex Chilton been on guitar. <br><br>But if a harmony falls into a microphone in the middle of America does anyone really hear it? Some do. Take for instance Shy Boys’ 2014 self-titled debut on local Kansas City label, High Dive Records - I first came across this album while living in Los Angeles and catching wind of a band from my home town that I was told could "actually sing," and after the first spin, through the muddy fidelity, man, could they actually sing. <br><br>Shy Boys’ history isn''t too dissimilar from any other Midwestern band. Like the many Replacements or Husker Düs before them - they exist neither here nor there, but instead, somewhere anonymously in the middle. And though you may not find the same opportunity floating in the middle as one would Here or There, you are allotted a certain amount of time and space to grow both yourself and your craft into what you want it to be. Over the past four years, that is exactly what Shy Boys have done and that is what brings us here today. <br><br>On August 3, 2018, the world will see the release of their second record, Bell House, out on legendary and globally cherished record label Polyvinyl, bringing both their profile and music to the surface for the first time. <br><br>The album’s title is taken from the band’s beloved headquarters - the old house on Bell Street in Kansas City where they lived together for the better part of 5 years. <br><br>“‘Lived’ is a loose term,” says lead songwriter Collin. “It was more like a bum den than anything else. There was a giant hole in the floor of the kitchen that had a piece of plywood over it. In the backyard, weeds got like 6 feet high in the summer. It was its own thriving biome. We lived in trash.” <br><br>Musically, Collin describes the songs on Bell House taking shape through “a group of guys trying to get through some sort of mutual identity crisis. The lifestyle became overwhelming and really seeped into the music.” <br><br>In the time since the release of ST, Collin saw himself falling in love and getting married, leaving the old house on Bell Street, and moving back into his mom’s house with his wife in a suburb of the city. It''s here where the songs of Bell House were born. Being back under the same roof he had grown up in where there was “still writing on the walls from childhood," Rausch found himself reflective and looking out at his life as a whole. <br><br>Take closing track “Champion” for instance, a song Collin says is dedicated to his and Kyle’s mother. “It’s just a note saying that she took care of us when we were young, and now it’s time for us to be there and take care of her.” <br><br>The reflective spirit sprinkled throughout the album is also evident on lead single, “Take The Doggie,” a bouncy, guitar driven track centered around wanting to secretly rescue their neighbor’s dog from an abusive owner, or on album highlight “Evil Sin,” which tackles the memory of drummer/bassist Konnor Ervin getting robbed. <br><br>But through all of this, Rausch kept his passion in his band, if even for nothing more than to - in his own words - have an excuse to keep hanging out with his brother and best friends. <br><br>“I have to keep Shy Boys alive to have a regular excuse to hang out with them,” says Collin. “To keep the band alive, I have to write songs. To be able to travel with my buddies, there has to be a new record.” <br><br>There is an old term that''s kicked around in country music called a "blood harmony" - in which two people in the same blood line, usually siblings, harmonize with one another in real time. Perhaps that is Shy Boys’ magic touch, putting them just a notch above all the other angels out there in the indie rock choir, and it makes sense, though no longer practicing evangelicals, Collin and Kyle grew up singing besides their parents in their church choir, so their keen sense of harmony is nothing new to them, but instead a life practice devoted to the voice as an instrument. <br><br>The result is Bell House, and the result is beautiful. There is something sensitive to the touch about this album, which is perhaps another way of saying that, well - Shy Boys are indeed Shy Boys. I envision the band as a solid unit, with each moving part as an equal. There is a heavy sense of family in everything they do both, literally and figuratively. Bruce Springsteen''s 1980 song “Highway Patrolman” always seems to come to mind; <br><br>"Yeah me and Franky out laughing and drinking, <br>Nothing feels better than blood on blood." <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Polyvinyl Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks)', '22:23', '53.7 / 136 / 247 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/3nyji7ju6uir/Shy_Boys_-_Bell_House_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-04 20:19:50.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-04 17:19:50', '2018-08-04 17:19:50');

He began his professional career as a musician in 1967 when he was recruited to join The Tennors, a vocal group who had already scored a big hit with "Pressure And The Slide" on Coxsone''s Studio One label. The group scored another massive hit in 1968 with "Ride Your Donkey" with more hits following in 1973 when Ronnie led the group on "Weather Report" for Duke Reid''s Treasure Isle label and "Take Heed" for Bunny Lee. Both records sold well, and with encouragement from Bunny Lee, Ronnie left the group to pursue a solo career. During the mid-''70s Ronnie was among the most prolific of Jamaica''s vocalists, recording over 100 titles for a variety of labels and producers including a large body of work for Bunny Lee. By the late ''70s Davis was producing his own work for release on his own On Top label while continuing to work for other producers. He bonded with producer Lloyd Campbell who released some of Davis'' best work on the Spider Man label and included "Won''t You Come Home" which became a minor hit due in part to the superb rhythm track from The Revolutionaires. Ronnie loved this record, and soon returned to Lloyd Campbell with Keith Porter, a friend from Savannah La Mar who had written a new song for the rhythm. Together they cut "In A Dis A Time" with Keith leading the fierce Rastafarian classic with sweet harmony from Ronnie. The song, credited to The Itals, became a massive local hit. They added a third singer, Lloyd Ricketts, and Campbell and continued recording. In late 1979, Robert Schoenfeld and Leroy Jodie Pierson of Nighthawk Records began searching for The Itals and after tracking them down, they found themselves gathered at Aquarius Studio listening to superb Spider Man tracks by the group.

Gulp are on a journey, a state of perpetual transition. The band make mini Kraut-pop epics, informed equally by the sun flares of the Californian desert and the drizzle of pure, sweet Scottish rain and northern light. Debut album ‘Season Sun’ was a home-grown delight, a ramshackle, endlessly inventive selection of dreamy psychedelic nuggets to watch the world flash past.<br><br>New album ‘All Good Wishes’ half-inches its title from a vintage Scottish postcard, and it’s emblematic of the changes the pair have undergone. “I think all through making this record we were looking at relocating,” Guto explains. “Whereas the first record was more of a road trip this is possibly a bit more focussed on home, and focussed on where we’re from and where we’re looking to go to. It’s partly a farewell to Wales, and hello to Scotland.”<br><br>The record was largely built in South Wales, a three-year process that saw the band retreat to their basement for endless sonic incisions and revisions. A broader, wider, perhaps bolder experience than their debut, ‘All Good Wishes’ is rooted in fantastic pop songwriting, in creating three minute vignettes that express complex ideas in a simple, accessible, endlessly fascinating way.

Rollin'' With the Flow', '<!--QuoteEBegin-->Four years after releasing their Merge debut, Frozen Letter, Spider Bags have returned with Someday Everything Will Be Fine, an LP that ascends to new levels of aural punch and perspective. The years that elapsed between records were crucial in enabling that progress to take place. “We had gone as far as we could go with touring all the time, and cranking out singles and our own records,” says frontman Dan McGee, reflecting on the prolific touring and recording pace he and his bandmates have kept up since 2007. “I really wanted to see what would happen if we were just concentrating on material instead of preparing for shows. We were really able to focus on maybe 12, 14 songs—knowing we were going to have to bring them down to 10—and I think it’s a better record for it. We rehearsed ‘My Heart Is a Flame in Reverse’ and ‘Reckless’ for a year before we recorded them. That’s not something we’ve ever had the time to do before.” Recorded in Memphis at Bunker Audio by Andrew McCalla (who also engineered Spider Bags’ seminal 2012 rock and roll party record Shake my Head), Someday Everything Will Be Fine leverages the limitations and glory of the Tascam 388, a vintage recording/mixing device that’s acquired a mythos via its association with legendary records by Dinosaur Jr., East River Pipe, the Black Keys, Ty Segall, and Thee Oh Sees to name a few. The Tascam’s charms are more immediate, with a visceral resonance all its own. “It’s an 8-track machine designed for smaller studios, so your eight tracks are on quarter-inch tape. It squashes the tracks so close together they bleed into each other, which, you know, shouldn’t work, but it does. There’s also a certain compression that happens on those machines that cannot be duplicated. It feels live, but it also sounds like it took place in a studio. It’s not about being an analog purist—it’s about finding the medium that works best for what you’re trying to create, and the band has never sounded better than we sound on this record. I wanted to do as much as we could live, the four of us together playing the guitar solos and tripping effects on the fly like we would at a show. I wanted to capture the performance without the use of infinite tracks and the ability to click away mistakes. You have to be well rehearsed to make a record that way. The album is almost entirely first takes. ‘Burning Sand’ is not only a first take but also the first time we played the song all the way through, with a minute-long instrumental opening that was completely off the cuff. That’s how my favorite rock and roll records were made. It’s the limitations, I think, that create the performance.” Recording in Memphis also lent its own mojo to the album’s sound and feel. According to McGee, “Rock and roll just sounds better there. I swear.” Adding to this sound is the featured playing of Memphis giants Jack Oblivian, John Whittemore, Jana Misener and Krista Wroten-Combest of the Memphis Dawls, and multi-instrumentalist Seth Moody. “It’s a great town with so much individuality and history, musical and otherwise, that can’t help but seep into the music you’re making. I love that city.” Other non-Spider Bag contributing musicians include Patrick Stickles of Titus Andronicus and Matthew Hoopengardner of Austin, Texas, rock and roll legends the Golden Boys. The LP opens with “Reckless,” a strangely organic-sounding sprawl wrought from different parts of songs that McGee had struggled to complete, which peaks with gorgeous guitar fireworks. “The song didn’t seem satisfied until I brought in a couple pieces from other songs I hadn’t finished,” says McGee. “Steve [Oliva, the band’s bassist] said when we finished recording it, ‘There’s seven parts in that song and none of them repeat.’” From that epic build-up, the record returns to earth with the sprightly “Oxcart Blues,” whose twinned guitars a...<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Merge Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-48kHz FLAC (tracks)', '38:27', '105 / 239 / 449 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/j9srnvv9hwu5/Someday_Everything_Will_Be_Fine_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-04 20:21:12.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-04 17:21:12', '2018-08-04 17:21:12'),

To me, that roughly means "the stuff from which stuff generates." It''s a short hand way of evoking all the elements that I''m mashing up in this music. The idea is basically that it''s this collision of genres, and collision of different versions of "American music." It''s also an album that doesn''t fit very neatly into a category of album — studio? live? remix? Maybe all, or none, of the above. This is a new mutant variety of Elephant Micah, better suited to survive the cultural climate of the moment in so-called "Trump''s America." It lives! I guess the lodestone in the process of making this was the kind of global avant garde mood that''s prevalent in a lot of 1980s albums I admire. Things like Joni Mitchell''s Dog Eat Dog and Arthur Russell''s Calling Out of Context. These records where singers were making really eclectic and outward looking productions — writing *through* the process of recording, and literally *play- ing* with technologies that were totally new to them. All the gear that I gathered to make the album was basically discarded or devalued. I got a bunch of stuff from Craigslist that interested me: a cheap FM synth, some Hindustani electronics, and an old three-head tape deck to use as a "poor man''s space echo." The icing on the cake is a one-of-a-kind home- made digital synthesizer called "The Mutant". I worked with my brother to design it. He built it and coded it. The concept of the synth is parallel to the concept of the album itself. It''s an electronic take on "folk" sounds (bends, drones, modal playing) and folk creative approaches (a cobbling together and reformatting of existing elements).<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Western Vinyl', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks)', '32:07', '74.6 / 136 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/n1k81xrhxhpn/Elephant_Micah_-_Genericana_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-04 20:21:18.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-04 17:21:18', '2018-08-04 17:21:18'),

Schubert began this composition in August 1824, or possibly even as late as March 1825. Most of the work on it took place in the summer of 1825, during the longest journey of his life. It took him from Vienna via Linz, Steyr, Gmunden (where he found the scenery "truly heavenly"), Salzburg and then up to Bad Gastein, where he saw some magnificent alpine peaks. The first page of the score manuscript is dated "March 1828" – possibly the month in which he finally completed the work. On November 19 of that same year, Schubert died at the age of only thirty-one. The symphony was premiered posthumously on March 21, 1839 in the Leipzig Gewandhaus, and conducted by the Gewandhaus Kapellmeister at that time - the 30-year-old Felix Mendelssohn.

Possibly it was the high regard in which he held the genre that for so long stopped him from actually completing a quartet of his own – although he had first seriously considered writing one in 1828, it took almost 15 years before he was ready to fully commit to the idea. Once he had done so, there was no returning: during some hectic summer weeks in 1842, a year which is often called ‘Schumann''s chamber music year’, he completed the three string quartets of his Op. 41, presenting them to his wife Clara on her 23rd birthday in September. In her diary she wrote ‘… they delighted me to the utmost. Everything in them is new, clear, expertly worked out and always idiomatic.’ <br><br>The Op.41 quartets were to be the only ones from Schumann''s pen, but this is not to suggest that he was dissatisfied with them: in 1847 he wrote to his publisher that he regarded the quartets ‘as my best work from earlier times’. They are here performed by the Norwegian Engegård Quartet, whose latest release on BIS, of quartets by Grieg and Sibelius, has received critical acclaim, for instance in Gramophone: ‘Those seeking the Grieg/Sibelius pairing in modern sound would be hard pressed to find better.’ <br><br>Schumann gave the three quartets to Clara for her 23rd birthday on 13th September 1842. In the couple’s shared diary she noted: ‘The gift of his three quartets – which he arranged to be performed for me... that very evening... – brought me the greatest joy. About the quartets, all I can say is that they delighted me to the utmost.

He’s wildly poetic, especially when recounting his dedication to music, and the work that led to this particular collection of delicately passionate songs. “These things became the vehicle by which we traveled, giving us reason to spend most of our lives in a van of uncertainty.” <br><br>Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread is the follow up to 2016’s Mowing — the first record he released under his own name, after fronting psych folk projects Page France and Cotton Jones — June 2017’s Some Twist, and its extension, The Load EP. The sprawling new album was recorded in Benny Yurco’s one-bedroom apartment in downtown Burlington, Vermont. Nau and his collaborators had a cool little set up going in Yurco’s spot — drums and bass took over the bedroom, the guitar amp in the bathroom, Nau’s vocals and piano in the living room, and a vibraphone in the kitchen. It’s the first time one of Nau’s records happened all in one place, and it feels most like a band record than ever before, he says; Nau and this particular group of musicians held it down together as a true team, which is why Nau named the record in their honor. Nothing more was added to it than what was recorded by Nau and the band in Yurco’s apartment. It didn’t feel like the right thing to do to mess with it post-facto, he adds. “It’s a documented live performance. It happened the way it happened, and that’s how it is.” <br><br>You can hear that organicness all across Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread, from the golden-sounding, glibly existential love song “Less Than Positive,” one of the oldest written on album, to the smoky and melancholic “Smudge,” one of the most recent compositions. “It wasn’t until recently that I ever considered revisiting songs from so long ago,” Nau says of playing songs he wrote ages ago, like “Less Than Positive.” “But something happened where I’m now able to appreciate the distance between those songs written long ago, and where I’m at now. It feels like playing someone else’s song.” Nau stresses this theme of time and distance in talking about the record. And those metaphysical thoughts permeate the music, which hangs in an ageless space, somehow classic-sounding and fresh like a cold wind, at the same time. <br><br>The songs on this layered record sound sunny and familiar, like sharing stories and worries with a close friend on a late summer day. In a gorgeous and natural way, he contemplates his own process, those feelings of uncertainty. “Making it too hard just comes easier,” Nau croons on “Funny In Real Life,” an exquisite meditation on creation and self. “Truth is such a beautiful force/And every time we find the chorus/There’s no second-guessing the real/I don’t ever know how I feel.” <br><br>Nau shines when he’s nestled in that medium between melancholy and carefree. He seems to be thinking about the past, present, and future, all at the same time, and his songs move between pain and joy, fires and rivers, faraway stars, icy Saturdays, clouds of smoke, between shelter and flowers in the rain. “And it just keeps going, if it’s done it’s done/Still flow in the flowing, all around the sun,” he sings on “Smudge,” the record’s finale, which is about love, and memories, and loneliness, and apprehension — “Something coming around some bend/Waiting for something to never end” — all at once. It’s all just part of the waves of life; sometimes you get stuck, or things move slower, and sometimes the pace steps up. And that seems to be the gist of Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread — that there are “different movements” in the self, that constantly figuring yourself out is all part of the journey. “As long as love is the motion,” Nau says, “it might get there.” Wherever there is. <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Full Time Hobby', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks)', '40:44', '95.8 / 238 / 436 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/plcnv59i4uzg/Michael_Nau_and_the_Mighty_Thread_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-05 20:18:15.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-05 17:18:15', '2018-08-05 17:18:15'),

Guitarist and lead vocalist Jeremy Stephens, fiddle player Corrina Rose Logston Stephens, and banjo player Kurt Stephenson assembled a list of decades-old songs that they could flawlessly recreate on stage, including some gems from the Stanley Brothers. Before long, the band  which would soon expand to include Vickie Vaughn on bass and Daniel Amick on mandolin  realized they could put their own stamp on the material without losing the integrity of the original recording. With that newfound perspective, High Fidelity handily won that year''s contest.<br><br>To all but the most dyed-in-the-wool bluegrass and old-time music devotees, the music on High Fidelity''s Rebel Records debut ''Hills And Home'' will come as a revelation.

The band also mines gems from lesser known  but no less worthy  acts such as the Lilly Brothers &amp; Don Stover, Wade Mainer, Jim &amp; Jesse, and the Country Gentlemen.<br><br>High Fidelity wooed fans and industry professionals alike when they mounted the stage of last year''s International Bluegrass Music Association showcase.

Comprised of brothers Collin and Kyle Rausch and best friends Konnor Ervin, Kyle Little and Ross Brown, Shy Boys are the heartland’s answer to The Beach Boys had Alex Chilton been on guitar. <br><br>But if a harmony falls into a microphone in the middle of America does anyone really hear it? Some do. Take for instance Shy Boys’ 2014 self-titled debut on local Kansas City label, High Dive Records - I first came across this album while living in Los Angeles and catching wind of a band from my home town that I was told could "actually sing," and after the first spin, through the muddy fidelity, man, could they actually sing. <br><br>Shy Boys’ history isn''t too dissimilar from any other Midwestern band. Like the many Replacements or Husker Düs before them - they exist neither here nor there, but instead, somewhere anonymously in the middle. And though you may not find the same opportunity floating in the middle as one would Here or There, you are allotted a certain amount of time and space to grow both yourself and your craft into what you want it to be. Over the past four years, that is exactly what Shy Boys have done and that is what brings us here today. <br><br>On August 3, 2018, the world will see the release of their second record, Bell House, out on legendary and globally cherished record label Polyvinyl, bringing both their profile and music to the surface for the first time. <br><br>The album’s title is taken from the band’s beloved headquarters - the old house on Bell Street in Kansas City where they lived together for the better part of 5 years. <br><br>“‘Lived’ is a loose term,” says lead songwriter Collin. “It was more like a bum den than anything else. There was a giant hole in the floor of the kitchen that had a piece of plywood over it. In the backyard, weeds got like 6 feet high in the summer. It was its own thriving biome. We lived in trash.” <br><br>Musically, Collin describes the songs on Bell House taking shape through “a group of guys trying to get through some sort of mutual identity crisis. The lifestyle became overwhelming and really seeped into the music.” <br><br>In the time since the release of ST, Collin saw himself falling in love and getting married, leaving the old house on Bell Street, and moving back into his mom’s house with his wife in a suburb of the city. It''s here where the songs of Bell House were born. Being back under the same roof he had grown up in where there was “still writing on the walls from childhood," Rausch found himself reflective and looking out at his life as a whole. <br><br>Take closing track “Champion” for instance, a song Collin says is dedicated to his and Kyle’s mother. “It’s just a note saying that she took care of us when we were young, and now it’s time for us to be there and take care of her.” <br><br>The reflective spirit sprinkled throughout the album is also evident on lead single, “Take The Doggie,” a bouncy, guitar driven track centered around wanting to secretly rescue their neighbor’s dog from an abusive owner, or on album highlight “Evil Sin,” which tackles the memory of drummer/bassist Konnor Ervin getting robbed. <br><br>But through all of this, Rausch kept his passion in his band, if even for nothing more than to - in his own words - have an excuse to keep hanging out with his brother and best friends. <br><br>“I have to keep Shy Boys alive to have a regular excuse to hang out with them,” says Collin. “To keep the band alive, I have to write songs. To be able to travel with my buddies, there has to be a new record.” <br><br>There is an old term that''s kicked around in country music called a "blood harmony" - in which two people in the same blood line, usually siblings, harmonize with one another in real time. Perhaps that is Shy Boys’ magic touch, putting them just a notch above all the other angels out there in the indie rock choir, and it makes sense, though no longer practicing evangelicals, Collin and Kyle grew up singing besides their parents in their church choir, so their keen sense of harmony is nothing new to them, but instead a life practice devoted to the voice as an instrument. <br><br>The result is Bell House, and the result is beautiful. There is something sensitive to the touch about this album, which is perhaps another way of saying that, well - Shy Boys are indeed Shy Boys. I envision the band as a solid unit, with each moving part as an equal. There is a heavy sense of family in everything they do both, literally and figuratively. Bruce Springsteen''s 1980 song “Highway Patrolman” always seems to come to mind; <br><br>"Yeah me and Franky out laughing and drinking, <br>Nothing feels better than blood on blood." <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Polyvinyl Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks)', '22:23', '53.7 / 136 / 247 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/3nyji7ju6uir/Shy_Boys_-_Bell_House_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-05 20:19:51.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-05 17:19:51', '2018-08-05 17:19:51'),

He began his professional career as a musician in 1967 when he was recruited to join The Tennors, a vocal group who had already scored a big hit with "Pressure And The Slide" on Coxsone''s Studio One label. The group scored another massive hit in 1968 with "Ride Your Donkey" with more hits following in 1973 when Ronnie led the group on "Weather Report" for Duke Reid''s Treasure Isle label and "Take Heed" for Bunny Lee. Both records sold well, and with encouragement from Bunny Lee, Ronnie left the group to pursue a solo career. During the mid-''70s Ronnie was among the most prolific of Jamaica''s vocalists, recording over 100 titles for a variety of labels and producers including a large body of work for Bunny Lee. By the late ''70s Davis was producing his own work for release on his own On Top label while continuing to work for other producers. He bonded with producer Lloyd Campbell who released some of Davis'' best work on the Spider Man label and included "Won''t You Come Home" which became a minor hit due in part to the superb rhythm track from The Revolutionaires.

They added a third singer, Lloyd Ricketts, and Campbell and continued recording.

Gulp are on a journey, a state of perpetual transition. The band make mini Kraut-pop epics, informed equally by the sun flares of the Californian desert and the drizzle of pure, sweet Scottish rain and northern light. Debut album ‘Season Sun’ was a home-grown delight, a ramshackle, endlessly inventive selection of dreamy psychedelic nuggets to watch the world flash past.<br><br>New album ‘All Good Wishes’ half-inches its title from a vintage Scottish postcard, and it’s emblematic of the changes the pair have undergone. “I think all through making this record we were looking at relocating,” Guto explains. “Whereas the first record was more of a road trip this is possibly a bit more focussed on home, and focussed on where we’re from and where we’re looking to go to. It’s partly a farewell to Wales, and hello to Scotland.”<br><br>The record was largely built in South Wales, a three-year process that saw the band retreat to their basement for endless sonic incisions and revisions. A broader, wider, perhaps bolder experience than their debut, ‘All Good Wishes’ is rooted in fantastic pop songwriting, in creating three minute vignettes that express complex ideas in a simple, accessible, endlessly fascinating way. Endlessly restrained yet infinitely open, each Gulp track is like a world in miniature, ideas borrowed from Krautrock and electronic culture slimmed down into these infinitely enjoyable pop songs.<br><br>Minimalist Kraut-pop with a dreamy, Cocteau Twins esque vibe, recent single ‘Morning Velvet Sky’ was a potent introduction to the duo’s ever-shifting realm. Following on from introductory cut ‘Search For Your Love’ - released on Tim Burgess’ esteemed O Genesis label - ‘Morning Velvet Sky’ was mixed by Luke Abbott, and the producer cast his eye over the record as a whole during the final mixdown in his home studio in Norwich<br><br>From Cardiff to Norwich and onwards to the Scottish East Coast, Gulp are tracing sonic ley-lines, empowering themselves, plugging into often over-looked artistic communities to fuel their next move. “We spent a lot of time on road trips listening to music, experiencing and enjoying different landscapes” he explains. “It’s especially apt in these times to see the good side of human nature; despite what the media portrays, people are generally sound, and it’s great be reminded of that in day-to-day living.<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'E.L.K.

Rollin'' With the Flow', '<!--QuoteEBegin-->Four years after releasing their Merge debut, Frozen Letter, Spider Bags have returned with Someday Everything Will Be Fine, an LP that ascends to new levels of aural punch and perspective. The years that elapsed between records were crucial in enabling that progress to take place. “We had gone as far as we could go with touring all the time, and cranking out singles and our own records,” says frontman Dan McGee, reflecting on the prolific touring and recording pace he and his bandmates have kept up since 2007. “I really wanted to see what would happen if we were just concentrating on material instead of preparing for shows. We were really able to focus on maybe 12, 14 songs—knowing we were going to have to bring them down to 10—and I think it’s a better record for it. We rehearsed ‘My Heart Is a Flame in Reverse’ and ‘Reckless’ for a year before we recorded them. That’s not something we’ve ever had the time to do before.” Recorded in Memphis at Bunker Audio by Andrew McCalla (who also engineered Spider Bags’ seminal 2012 rock and roll party record Shake my Head), Someday Everything Will Be Fine leverages the limitations and glory of the Tascam 388, a vintage recording/mixing device that’s acquired a mythos via its association with legendary records by Dinosaur Jr., East River Pipe, the Black Keys, Ty Segall, and Thee Oh Sees to name a few. The Tascam’s charms are more immediate, with a visceral resonance all its own. “It’s an 8-track machine designed for smaller studios, so your eight tracks are on quarter-inch tape. It squashes the tracks so close together they bleed into each other, which, you know, shouldn’t work, but it does. There’s also a certain compression that happens on those machines that cannot be duplicated. It feels live, but it also sounds like it took place in a studio. It’s not about being an analog purist—it’s about finding the medium that works best for what you’re trying to create, and the band has never sounded better than we sound on this record. I wanted to do as much as we could live, the four of us together playing the guitar solos and tripping effects on the fly like we would at a show. I wanted to capture the performance without the use of infinite tracks and the ability to click away mistakes. You have to be well rehearsed to make a record that way. The album is almost entirely first takes. ‘Burning Sand’ is not only a first take but also the first time we played the song all the way through, with a minute-long instrumental opening that was completely off the cuff. That’s how my favorite rock and roll records were made. It’s the limitations, I think, that create the performance.” Recording in Memphis also lent its own mojo to the album’s sound and feel. According to McGee, “Rock and roll just sounds better there. I swear.” Adding to this sound is the featured playing of Memphis giants Jack Oblivian, John Whittemore, Jana Misener and Krista Wroten-Combest of the Memphis Dawls, and multi-instrumentalist Seth Moody. “It’s a great town with so much individuality and history, musical and otherwise, that can’t help but seep into the music you’re making. I love that city.” Other non-Spider Bag contributing musicians include Patrick Stickles of Titus Andronicus and Matthew Hoopengardner of Austin, Texas, rock and roll legends the Golden Boys. The LP opens with “Reckless,” a strangely organic-sounding sprawl wrought from different parts of songs that McGee had struggled to complete, which peaks with gorgeous guitar fireworks. “The song didn’t seem satisfied until I brought in a couple pieces from other songs I hadn’t finished,” says McGee. “Steve [Oliva, the band’s bassist] said when we finished recording it, ‘There’s seven parts in that song and none of them repeat.’” From that epic build-up, the record returns to earth with the sprightly “Oxcart Blues,” whose twinned guitars a...<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Merge Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-48kHz FLAC (tracks)', '38:27', '105 / 239 / 449 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/j9srnvv9hwu5/Someday_Everything_Will_Be_Fine_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-05 20:21:17.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-05 17:21:17', '2018-08-05 17:21:17'),

To me, that roughly means "the stuff from which stuff generates." It''s a short hand way of evoking all the elements that I''m mashing up in this music. The idea is basically that it''s this collision of genres, and collision of different versions of "American music." It''s also an album that doesn''t fit very neatly into a category of album — studio? live? remix? Maybe all, or none, of the above. This is a new mutant variety of Elephant Micah, better suited to survive the cultural climate of the moment in so-called "Trump''s America." It lives! I guess the lodestone in the process of making this was the kind of global avant garde mood that''s prevalent in a lot of 1980s albums I admire. Things like Joni Mitchell''s Dog Eat Dog and Arthur Russell''s Calling Out of Context. These records where singers were making really eclectic and outward looking productions — writing *through* the process of recording, and literally *play- ing* with technologies that were totally new to them. All the gear that I gathered to make the album was basically discarded or devalued. I got a bunch of stuff from Craigslist that interested me: a cheap FM synth, some Hindustani electronics, and an old three-head tape deck to use as a "poor man''s space echo." The icing on the cake is a one-of-a-kind home- made digital synthesizer called "The Mutant". I worked with my brother to design it. He built it and coded it. The concept of the synth is parallel to the concept of the album itself. It''s an electronic take on "folk" sounds (bends, drones, modal playing) and folk creative approaches (a cobbling together and reformatting of existing elements).<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Western Vinyl', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks)', '32:07', '74.6 / 136 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/n1k81xrhxhpn/Elephant_Micah_-_Genericana_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-05 20:21:22.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-05 17:21:22', '2018-08-05 17:21:22'),

Schubert began this composition in August 1824, or possibly even as late as March 1825. Most of the work on it took place in the summer of 1825, during the longest journey of his life. It took him from Vienna via Linz, Steyr, Gmunden (where he found the scenery "truly heavenly"), Salzburg and then up to Bad Gastein, where he saw some magnificent alpine peaks. The first page of the score manuscript is dated "March 1828" – possibly the month in which he finally completed the work. On November 19 of that same year, Schubert died at the age of only thirty-one. The symphony was premiered posthumously on March 21, 1839 in the Leipzig Gewandhaus, and conducted by the Gewandhaus Kapellmeister at that time - the 30-year-old Felix Mendelssohn.

Founded in 2016, Trio Klengel is named after August Klengel with the purpose of promoting his works. The ensemble decided to continue the work of the original Klengel Trio, founded in 1912. This trio consisted of the three daughters of the composer Julius Klengel, a relative of August Klengel. Just like the first Klengel Trio, this ensemble is also dedicated to promoting chamber music of long-forgotten composers and their works through concerts and recording projects. <br><br>Anna Petrova, piano<br>Trio Klengel<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Toccata Classics', NULL, 'FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks+booklet)', '01:13:35', '286 / 645 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/01s4gews2se4/Trio_Klengel_-_Klengel_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-06 20:16:00.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-06 17:16:00', '2018-08-06 17:16:00'),

Possibly it was the high regard in which he held the genre that for so long stopped him from actually completing a quartet of his own – although he had first seriously considered writing one in 1828, it took almost 15 years before he was ready to fully commit to the idea. Once he had done so, there was no returning: during some hectic summer weeks in 1842, a year which is often called ‘Schumann''s chamber music year’, he completed the three string quartets of his Op. 41, presenting them to his wife Clara on her 23rd birthday in September. In her diary she wrote ‘… they delighted me to the utmost. Everything in them is new, clear, expertly worked out and always idiomatic.’ <br><br>The Op.41 quartets were to be the only ones from Schumann''s pen, but this is not to suggest that he was dissatisfied with them: in 1847 he wrote to his publisher that he regarded the quartets ‘as my best work from earlier times’. They are here performed by the Norwegian Engegård Quartet, whose latest release on BIS, of quartets by Grieg and Sibelius, has received critical acclaim, for instance in Gramophone: ‘Those seeking the Grieg/Sibelius pairing in modern sound would be hard pressed to find better.’ <br><br>Schumann gave the three quartets to Clara for her 23rd birthday on 13th September 1842. In the couple’s shared diary she noted: ‘The gift of his three quartets – which he arranged to be performed for me... that very evening... – brought me the greatest joy. About the quartets, all I can say is that they delighted me to the utmost. Everything in them is new, clear, expertly worked out and always idiomatic.’ The fact that Schumann wrote no more string quartets does not indicate that he was dissatisfied with them: in 1847 he wrote to his publisher Härtel that he still regarded the quartets ‘as my best work from earlier times’. And posterity has unanimously shared the view of the eminent Viennese critic Eduard Hanslick that the three Op. 41 quartets ‘are among the all-time jewels of chamber music’.

He’s wildly poetic, especially when recounting his dedication to music, and the work that led to this particular collection of delicately passionate songs. “These things became the vehicle by which we traveled, giving us reason to spend most of our lives in a van of uncertainty.” <br><br>Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread is the follow up to 2016’s Mowing — the first record he released under his own name, after fronting psych folk projects Page France and Cotton Jones — June 2017’s Some Twist, and its extension, The Load EP. The sprawling new album was recorded in Benny Yurco’s one-bedroom apartment in downtown Burlington, Vermont. Nau and his collaborators had a cool little set up going in Yurco’s spot — drums and bass took over the bedroom, the guitar amp in the bathroom, Nau’s vocals and piano in the living room, and a vibraphone in the kitchen. It’s the first time one of Nau’s records happened all in one place, and it feels most like a band record than ever before, he says; Nau and this particular group of musicians held it down together as a true team, which is why Nau named the record in their honor. Nothing more was added to it than what was recorded by Nau and the band in Yurco’s apartment. It didn’t feel like the right thing to do to mess with it post-facto, he adds. “It’s a documented live performance. It happened the way it happened, and that’s how it is.” <br><br>You can hear that organicness all across Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread, from the golden-sounding, glibly existential love song “Less Than Positive,” one of the oldest written on album, to the smoky and melancholic “Smudge,” one of the most recent compositions. “It wasn’t until recently that I ever considered revisiting songs from so long ago,” Nau says of playing songs he wrote ages ago, like “Less Than Positive.” “But something happened where I’m now able to appreciate the distance between those songs written long ago, and where I’m at now. It feels like playing someone else’s song.” Nau stresses this theme of time and distance in talking about the record. And those metaphysical thoughts permeate the music, which hangs in an ageless space, somehow classic-sounding and fresh like a cold wind, at the same time. <br><br>The songs on this layered record sound sunny and familiar, like sharing stories and worries with a close friend on a late summer day. In a gorgeous and natural way, he contemplates his own process, those feelings of uncertainty. “Making it too hard just comes easier,” Nau croons on “Funny In Real Life,” an exquisite meditation on creation and self. “Truth is such a beautiful force/And every time we find the chorus/There’s no second-guessing the real/I don’t ever know how I feel.” <br><br>Nau shines when he’s nestled in that medium between melancholy and carefree. He seems to be thinking about the past, present, and future, all at the same time, and his songs move between pain and joy, fires and rivers, faraway stars, icy Saturdays, clouds of smoke, between shelter and flowers in the rain. “And it just keeps going, if it’s done it’s done/Still flow in the flowing, all around the sun,” he sings on “Smudge,” the record’s finale, which is about love, and memories, and loneliness, and apprehension — “Something coming around some bend/Waiting for something to never end” — all at once. It’s all just part of the waves of life; sometimes you get stuck, or things move slower, and sometimes the pace steps up. And that seems to be the gist of Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread — that there are “different movements” in the self, that constantly figuring yourself out is all part of the journey. “As long as love is the motion,” Nau says, “it might get there.” Wherever there is. <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Full Time Hobby', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks)', '40:44', '95.8 / 238 / 436 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/plcnv59i4uzg/Michael_Nau_and_the_Mighty_Thread_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-06 20:18:14.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-06 17:18:15', '2018-08-06 17:18:15'),

Comprised of brothers Collin and Kyle Rausch and best friends Konnor Ervin, Kyle Little and Ross Brown, Shy Boys are the heartland’s answer to The Beach Boys had Alex Chilton been on guitar. <br><br>But if a harmony falls into a microphone in the middle of America does anyone really hear it? Some do. Take for instance Shy Boys’ 2014 self-titled debut on local Kansas City label, High Dive Records - I first came across this album while living in Los Angeles and catching wind of a band from my home town that I was told could "actually sing," and after the first spin, through the muddy fidelity, man, could they actually sing. <br><br>Shy Boys’ history isn''t too dissimilar from any other Midwestern band. Like the many Replacements or Husker Düs before them - they exist neither here nor there, but instead, somewhere anonymously in the middle. And though you may not find the same opportunity floating in the middle as one would Here or There, you are allotted a certain amount of time and space to grow both yourself and your craft into what you want it to be. Over the past four years, that is exactly what Shy Boys have done and that is what brings us here today. <br><br>On August 3, 2018, the world will see the release of their second record, Bell House, out on legendary and globally cherished record label Polyvinyl, bringing both their profile and music to the surface for the first time. <br><br>The album’s title is taken from the band’s beloved headquarters - the old house on Bell Street in Kansas City where they lived together for the better part of 5 years. <br><br>“‘Lived’ is a loose term,” says lead songwriter Collin. “It was more like a bum den than anything else. There was a giant hole in the floor of the kitchen that had a piece of plywood over it. In the backyard, weeds got like 6 feet high in the summer. It was its own thriving biome. We lived in trash.” <br><br>Musically, Collin describes the songs on Bell House taking shape through “a group of guys trying to get through some sort of mutual identity crisis. The lifestyle became overwhelming and really seeped into the music.” <br><br>In the time since the release of ST, Collin saw himself falling in love and getting married, leaving the old house on Bell Street, and moving back into his mom’s house with his wife in a suburb of the city. It''s here where the songs of Bell House were born. Being back under the same roof he had grown up in where there was “still writing on the walls from childhood," Rausch found himself reflective and looking out at his life as a whole. <br><br>Take closing track “Champion” for instance, a song Collin says is dedicated to his and Kyle’s mother. “It’s just a note saying that she took care of us when we were young, and now it’s time for us to be there and take care of her.” <br><br>The reflective spirit sprinkled throughout the album is also evident on lead single, “Take The Doggie,” a bouncy, guitar driven track centered around wanting to secretly rescue their neighbor’s dog from an abusive owner, or on album highlight “Evil Sin,” which tackles the memory of drummer/bassist Konnor Ervin getting robbed. <br><br>But through all of this, Rausch kept his passion in his band, if even for nothing more than to - in his own words - have an excuse to keep hanging out with his brother and best friends. <br><br>“I have to keep Shy Boys alive to have a regular excuse to hang out with them,” says Collin. “To keep the band alive, I have to write songs. To be able to travel with my buddies, there has to be a new record.” <br><br>There is an old term that''s kicked around in country music called a "blood harmony" - in which two people in the same blood line, usually siblings, harmonize with one another in real time. Perhaps that is Shy Boys’ magic touch, putting them just a notch above all the other angels out there in the indie rock choir, and it makes sense, though no longer practicing evangelicals, Collin and Kyle grew up singing besides their parents in their church choir, so their keen sense of harmony is nothing new to them, but instead a life practice devoted to the voice as an instrument. <br><br>The result is Bell House, and the result is beautiful. There is something sensitive to the touch about this album, which is perhaps another way of saying that, well - Shy Boys are indeed Shy Boys. I envision the band as a solid unit, with each moving part as an equal. There is a heavy sense of family in everything they do both, literally and figuratively. Bruce Springsteen''s 1980 song “Highway Patrolman” always seems to come to mind; <br><br>"Yeah me and Franky out laughing and drinking, <br>Nothing feels better than blood on blood." <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Polyvinyl Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks)', '22:23', '53.7 / 136 / 247 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/3nyji7ju6uir/Shy_Boys_-_Bell_House_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-06 20:19:49.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-06 17:19:50', '2018-08-06 17:19:50'),

Ronnie Davis was born in Savannah La Mar in Jamaica''s Westmorland Parish in July of 1950. He began his professional career as a musician in 1967 when he was recruited to join The Tennors, a vocal group who had already scored a big hit with "Pressure And The Slide" on Coxsone''s Studio One label. The group scored another massive hit in 1968 with "Ride Your Donkey" with more hits following in 1973 when Ronnie led the group on "Weather Report" for Duke Reid''s Treasure Isle label and "Take Heed" for Bunny Lee. Both records sold well, and with encouragement from Bunny Lee, Ronnie left the group to pursue a solo career. During the mid-''70s Ronnie was among the most prolific of Jamaica''s vocalists, recording over 100 titles for a variety of labels and producers including a large body of work for Bunny Lee. By the late ''70s Davis was producing his own work for release on his own On Top label while continuing to work for other producers. He bonded with producer Lloyd Campbell who released some of Davis'' best work on the Spider Man label and included "Won''t You Come Home" which became a minor hit due in part to the superb rhythm track from The Revolutionaires. Ronnie loved this record, and soon returned to Lloyd Campbell with Keith Porter, a friend from Savannah La Mar who had written a new song for the rhythm.

Includes 2 previously unissued bonus tracks.  New liner notes from Nighthawk co-founder Leroy Jodie Pierson.  Previously unseen photos and ephemera. Ronnie Davis was born in Savannah La Mar in Jamaica''s Westmorland Parish in July of 1950. He began his professional career as a musician in 1967 when he was recruited to join The Tennors, a vocal group who had already scored a big hit with "Pressure And The Slide" on Coxsone''s Studio One label. The group scored another massive hit in 1968 with "Ride Your Donkey" with more hits following in 1973 when Ronnie led the group on "Weather Report" for Duke Reid''s Treasure Isle label and "Take Heed" for Bunny Lee. Both records sold well, and with encouragement from Bunny Lee, Ronnie left the group to pursue a solo career. During the mid-''70s Ronnie was among the most prolific of Jamaica''s vocalists, recording over 100 titles for a variety of labels and producers including a large body of work for Bunny Lee. By the late ''70s Davis was producing his own work for release on his own On Top label while continuing to work for other producers. He bonded with producer Lloyd Campbell who released some of Davis'' best work on the Spider Man label and included "Won''t You Come Home" which became a minor hit due in part to the superb rhythm track from The Revolutionaires. Ronnie loved this record, and soon returned to Lloyd Campbell with Keith Porter, a friend from Savannah La Mar who had written a new song for the rhythm. Together they cut "In A Dis A Time" with Keith leading the fierce Rastafarian classic with sweet harmony from Ronnie. The song, credited to The Itals, became a massive local hit.

Gulp are on a journey, a state of perpetual transition. The band make mini Kraut-pop epics, informed equally by the sun flares of the Californian desert and the drizzle of pure, sweet Scottish rain and northern light. Debut album ‘Season Sun’ was a home-grown delight, a ramshackle, endlessly inventive selection of dreamy psychedelic nuggets to watch the world flash past.<br><br>New album ‘All Good Wishes’ half-inches its title from a vintage Scottish postcard, and it’s emblematic of the changes the pair have undergone. “I think all through making this record we were looking at relocating,” Guto explains. “Whereas the first record was more of a road trip this is possibly a bit more focussed on home, and focussed on where we’re from and where we’re looking to go to. It’s partly a farewell to Wales, and hello to Scotland.”<br><br>The record was largely built in South Wales, a three-year process that saw the band retreat to their basement for endless sonic incisions and revisions. A broader, wider, perhaps bolder experience than their debut, ‘All Good Wishes’ is rooted in fantastic pop songwriting, in creating three minute vignettes that express complex ideas in a simple, accessible, endlessly fascinating way. Endlessly restrained yet infinitely open, each Gulp track is like a world in miniature, ideas borrowed from Krautrock and electronic culture slimmed down into these infinitely enjoyable pop songs.<br><br>Minimalist Kraut-pop with a dreamy, Cocteau Twins esque vibe, recent single ‘Morning Velvet Sky’ was a potent introduction to the duo’s ever-shifting realm.

Rollin'' With the Flow', '<!--QuoteEBegin-->Four years after releasing their Merge debut, Frozen Letter, Spider Bags have returned with Someday Everything Will Be Fine, an LP that ascends to new levels of aural punch and perspective. The years that elapsed between records were crucial in enabling that progress to take place. “We had gone as far as we could go with touring all the time, and cranking out singles and our own records,” says frontman Dan McGee, reflecting on the prolific touring and recording pace he and his bandmates have kept up since 2007. “I really wanted to see what would happen if we were just concentrating on material instead of preparing for shows. We were really able to focus on maybe 12, 14 songs—knowing we were going to have to bring them down to 10—and I think it’s a better record for it. We rehearsed ‘My Heart Is a Flame in Reverse’ and ‘Reckless’ for a year before we recorded them. That’s not something we’ve ever had the time to do before.” Recorded in Memphis at Bunker Audio by Andrew McCalla (who also engineered Spider Bags’ seminal 2012 rock and roll party record Shake my Head), Someday Everything Will Be Fine leverages the limitations and glory of the Tascam 388, a vintage recording/mixing device that’s acquired a mythos via its association with legendary records by Dinosaur Jr., East River Pipe, the Black Keys, Ty Segall, and Thee Oh Sees to name a few. The Tascam’s charms are more immediate, with a visceral resonance all its own. “It’s an 8-track machine designed for smaller studios, so your eight tracks are on quarter-inch tape. It squashes the tracks so close together they bleed into each other, which, you know, shouldn’t work, but it does. There’s also a certain compression that happens on those machines that cannot be duplicated. It feels live, but it also sounds like it took place in a studio. It’s not about being an analog purist—it’s about finding the medium that works best for what you’re trying to create, and the band has never sounded better than we sound on this record. I wanted to do as much as we could live, the four of us together playing the guitar solos and tripping effects on the fly like we would at a show. I wanted to capture the performance without the use of infinite tracks and the ability to click away mistakes. You have to be well rehearsed to make a record that way. The album is almost entirely first takes. ‘Burning Sand’ is not only a first take but also the first time we played the song all the way through, with a minute-long instrumental opening that was completely off the cuff. That’s how my favorite rock and roll records were made. It’s the limitations, I think, that create the performance.” Recording in Memphis also lent its own mojo to the album’s sound and feel. According to McGee, “Rock and roll just sounds better there. I swear.” Adding to this sound is the featured playing of Memphis giants Jack Oblivian, John Whittemore, Jana Misener and Krista Wroten-Combest of the Memphis Dawls, and multi-instrumentalist Seth Moody. “It’s a great town with so much individuality and history, musical and otherwise, that can’t help but seep into the music you’re making. I love that city.” Other non-Spider Bag contributing musicians include Patrick Stickles of Titus Andronicus and Matthew Hoopengardner of Austin, Texas, rock and roll legends the Golden Boys. The LP opens with “Reckless,” a strangely organic-sounding sprawl wrought from different parts of songs that McGee had struggled to complete, which peaks with gorgeous guitar fireworks. “The song didn’t seem satisfied until I brought in a couple pieces from other songs I hadn’t finished,” says McGee. “Steve [Oliva, the band’s bassist] said when we finished recording it, ‘There’s seven parts in that song and none of them repeat.’” From that epic build-up, the record returns to earth with the sprightly “Oxcart Blues,” whose twinned guitars a...<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Merge Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-48kHz FLAC (tracks)', '38:27', '105 / 239 / 449 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/j9srnvv9hwu5/Someday_Everything_Will_Be_Fine_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-06 20:21:12.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-06 17:21:13', '2018-08-06 17:21:13'),

To me, that roughly means "the stuff from which stuff generates." It''s a short hand way of evoking all the elements that I''m mashing up in this music. The idea is basically that it''s this collision of genres, and collision of different versions of "American music." It''s also an album that doesn''t fit very neatly into a category of album — studio? live? remix? Maybe all, or none, of the above. This is a new mutant variety of Elephant Micah, better suited to survive the cultural climate of the moment in so-called "Trump''s America." It lives! I guess the lodestone in the process of making this was the kind of global avant garde mood that''s prevalent in a lot of 1980s albums I admire. Things like Joni Mitchell''s Dog Eat Dog and Arthur Russell''s Calling Out of Context. These records where singers were making really eclectic and outward looking productions — writing *through* the process of recording, and literally *play- ing* with technologies that were totally new to them. All the gear that I gathered to make the album was basically discarded or devalued. I got a bunch of stuff from Craigslist that interested me: a cheap FM synth, some Hindustani electronics, and an old three-head tape deck to use as a "poor man''s space echo." The icing on the cake is a one-of-a-kind home- made digital synthesizer called "The Mutant". I worked with my brother to design it. He built it and coded it. The concept of the synth is parallel to the concept of the album itself. It''s an electronic take on "folk" sounds (bends, drones, modal playing) and folk creative approaches (a cobbling together and reformatting of existing elements).<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Western Vinyl', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks)', '32:07', '74.6 / 136 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/n1k81xrhxhpn/Elephant_Micah_-_Genericana_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-06 20:21:18.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-06 17:21:18', '2018-08-06 17:21:18'),

The record touches upon contemporary fissures in society, with Tim Booth commenting: "We knew something was up when Leicester city won the league then Brexit, then Trump. It is as if we''d slipped into an alternate reality, a Philip K Dick reality. We are living in extraordinary times." The album was produced by Mercury and Brit Award winner Charlie Andrew (whose previous work includes alt-J and Wolf Alice) and rising star Beni Giles.<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Infectious Music', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks)', '01:15:44', '176 / 488 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/h8tyrq9pyljv/Living_in_Extraordinary_Times_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-06 20:21:41.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-06 17:21:41', '2018-08-06 17:21:41'),

Schubert began this composition in August 1824, or possibly even as late as March 1825. Most of the work on it took place in the summer of 1825, during the longest journey of his life. It took him from Vienna via Linz, Steyr, Gmunden (where he found the scenery "truly heavenly"), Salzburg and then up to Bad Gastein, where he saw some magnificent alpine peaks. The first page of the score manuscript is dated "March 1828" – possibly the month in which he finally completed the work. On November 19 of that same year, Schubert died at the age of only thirty-one. The symphony was premiered posthumously on March 21, 1839 in the Leipzig Gewandhaus, and conducted by the Gewandhaus Kapellmeister at that time - the 30-year-old Felix Mendelssohn.

If, on the one hand, the vocal quartet shows that the “grace notes” (“quiebros”) and voice effects do not constitute an impediment for the care of tuning, on the other hand the harp adds to the score beautiful introductory and transition passages based on the features of passacaglias and 17th century dances. <br><br>Rocío de Frutos, treble<br>Verónica Plata, treble<br>Gabriel Díaz, alto<br>Víctor Sordo, tenor<br>Javier Cuevas, bass<br>Manuel Vilas, double harp (arpa de dos órdenes)<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'IBS Classical', NULL, 'FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-48kHz FLAC (tracks+booklet)', '57:31', '280 / 599 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/zwd66inb7tfc/Ars_Atlantica_-_Hirviendo_el_Mar_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-07 20:15:47.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-07 17:15:47', '2018-08-07 17:15:47'),

Possibly it was the high regard in which he held the genre that for so long stopped him from actually completing a quartet of his own – although he had first seriously considered writing one in 1828, it took almost 15 years before he was ready to fully commit to the idea. Once he had done so, there was no returning: during some hectic summer weeks in 1842, a year which is often called ‘Schumann''s chamber music year’, he completed the three string quartets of his Op. 41, presenting them to his wife Clara on her 23rd birthday in September. In her diary she wrote ‘… they delighted me to the utmost. Everything in them is new, clear, expertly worked out and always idiomatic.’ <br><br>The Op.41 quartets were to be the only ones from Schumann''s pen, but this is not to suggest that he was dissatisfied with them: in 1847 he wrote to his publisher that he regarded the quartets ‘as my best work from earlier times’. They are here performed by the Norwegian Engegård Quartet, whose latest release on BIS, of quartets by Grieg and Sibelius, has received critical acclaim, for instance in Gramophone: ‘Those seeking the Grieg/Sibelius pairing in modern sound would be hard pressed to find better.’ <br><br>Schumann gave the three quartets to Clara for her 23rd birthday on 13th September 1842. In the couple’s shared diary she noted: ‘The gift of his three quartets – which he arranged to be performed for me... that very evening... – brought me the greatest joy. About the quartets, all I can say is that they delighted me to the utmost. Everything in them is new, clear, expertly worked out and always idiomatic.’ The fact that Schumann wrote no more string quartets does not indicate that he was dissatisfied with them: in 1847 he wrote to his publisher Härtel that he still regarded the quartets ‘as my best work from earlier times’. And posterity has unanimously shared the view of the eminent Viennese critic Eduard Hanslick that the three Op. 41 quartets ‘are among the all-time jewels of chamber music’.

He’s wildly poetic, especially when recounting his dedication to music, and the work that led to this particular collection of delicately passionate songs. “These things became the vehicle by which we traveled, giving us reason to spend most of our lives in a van of uncertainty.” <br><br>Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread is the follow up to 2016’s Mowing — the first record he released under his own name, after fronting psych folk projects Page France and Cotton Jones — June 2017’s Some Twist, and its extension, The Load EP. The sprawling new album was recorded in Benny Yurco’s one-bedroom apartment in downtown Burlington, Vermont. Nau and his collaborators had a cool little set up going in Yurco’s spot — drums and bass took over the bedroom, the guitar amp in the bathroom, Nau’s vocals and piano in the living room, and a vibraphone in the kitchen. It’s the first time one of Nau’s records happened all in one place, and it feels most like a band record than ever before, he says; Nau and this particular group of musicians held it down together as a true team, which is why Nau named the record in their honor. Nothing more was added to it than what was recorded by Nau and the band in Yurco’s apartment. It didn’t feel like the right thing to do to mess with it post-facto, he adds. “It’s a documented live performance. It happened the way it happened, and that’s how it is.” <br><br>You can hear that organicness all across Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread, from the golden-sounding, glibly existential love song “Less Than Positive,” one of the oldest written on album, to the smoky and melancholic “Smudge,” one of the most recent compositions. “It wasn’t until recently that I ever considered revisiting songs from so long ago,” Nau says of playing songs he wrote ages ago, like “Less Than Positive.” “But something happened where I’m now able to appreciate the distance between those songs written long ago, and where I’m at now. It feels like playing someone else’s song.” Nau stresses this theme of time and distance in talking about the record. And those metaphysical thoughts permeate the music, which hangs in an ageless space, somehow classic-sounding and fresh like a cold wind, at the same time. <br><br>The songs on this layered record sound sunny and familiar, like sharing stories and worries with a close friend on a late summer day. In a gorgeous and natural way, he contemplates his own process, those feelings of uncertainty. “Making it too hard just comes easier,” Nau croons on “Funny In Real Life,” an exquisite meditation on creation and self. “Truth is such a beautiful force/And every time we find the chorus/There’s no second-guessing the real/I don’t ever know how I feel.” <br><br>Nau shines when he’s nestled in that medium between melancholy and carefree. He seems to be thinking about the past, present, and future, all at the same time, and his songs move between pain and joy, fires and rivers, faraway stars, icy Saturdays, clouds of smoke, between shelter and flowers in the rain. “And it just keeps going, if it’s done it’s done/Still flow in the flowing, all around the sun,” he sings on “Smudge,” the record’s finale, which is about love, and memories, and loneliness, and apprehension — “Something coming around some bend/Waiting for something to never end” — all at once. It’s all just part of the waves of life; sometimes you get stuck, or things move slower, and sometimes the pace steps up. And that seems to be the gist of Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread — that there are “different movements” in the self, that constantly figuring yourself out is all part of the journey. “As long as love is the motion,” Nau says, “it might get there.” Wherever there is. <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Full Time Hobby', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks)', '40:44', '95.8 / 238 / 436 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/plcnv59i4uzg/Michael_Nau_and_the_Mighty_Thread_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-07 20:18:14.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-07 17:18:14', '2018-08-07 17:18:14'),

Comprised of brothers Collin and Kyle Rausch and best friends Konnor Ervin, Kyle Little and Ross Brown, Shy Boys are the heartland’s answer to The Beach Boys had Alex Chilton been on guitar. <br><br>But if a harmony falls into a microphone in the middle of America does anyone really hear it? Some do. Take for instance Shy Boys’ 2014 self-titled debut on local Kansas City label, High Dive Records - I first came across this album while living in Los Angeles and catching wind of a band from my home town that I was told could "actually sing," and after the first spin, through the muddy fidelity, man, could they actually sing. <br><br>Shy Boys’ history isn''t too dissimilar from any other Midwestern band. Like the many Replacements or Husker Düs before them - they exist neither here nor there, but instead, somewhere anonymously in the middle. And though you may not find the same opportunity floating in the middle as one would Here or There, you are allotted a certain amount of time and space to grow both yourself and your craft into what you want it to be. Over the past four years, that is exactly what Shy Boys have done and that is what brings us here today. <br><br>On August 3, 2018, the world will see the release of their second record, Bell House, out on legendary and globally cherished record label Polyvinyl, bringing both their profile and music to the surface for the first time. <br><br>The album’s title is taken from the band’s beloved headquarters - the old house on Bell Street in Kansas City where they lived together for the better part of 5 years. <br><br>“‘Lived’ is a loose term,” says lead songwriter Collin. “It was more like a bum den than anything else. There was a giant hole in the floor of the kitchen that had a piece of plywood over it. In the backyard, weeds got like 6 feet high in the summer. It was its own thriving biome. We lived in trash.” <br><br>Musically, Collin describes the songs on Bell House taking shape through “a group of guys trying to get through some sort of mutual identity crisis. The lifestyle became overwhelming and really seeped into the music.” <br><br>In the time since the release of ST, Collin saw himself falling in love and getting married, leaving the old house on Bell Street, and moving back into his mom’s house with his wife in a suburb of the city. It''s here where the songs of Bell House were born. Being back under the same roof he had grown up in where there was “still writing on the walls from childhood," Rausch found himself reflective and looking out at his life as a whole. <br><br>Take closing track “Champion” for instance, a song Collin says is dedicated to his and Kyle’s mother. “It’s just a note saying that she took care of us when we were young, and now it’s time for us to be there and take care of her.” <br><br>The reflective spirit sprinkled throughout the album is also evident on lead single, “Take The Doggie,” a bouncy, guitar driven track centered around wanting to secretly rescue their neighbor’s dog from an abusive owner, or on album highlight “Evil Sin,” which tackles the memory of drummer/bassist Konnor Ervin getting robbed. <br><br>But through all of this, Rausch kept his passion in his band, if even for nothing more than to - in his own words - have an excuse to keep hanging out with his brother and best friends. <br><br>“I have to keep Shy Boys alive to have a regular excuse to hang out with them,” says Collin. “To keep the band alive, I have to write songs. To be able to travel with my buddies, there has to be a new record.” <br><br>There is an old term that''s kicked around in country music called a "blood harmony" - in which two people in the same blood line, usually siblings, harmonize with one another in real time. Perhaps that is Shy Boys’ magic touch, putting them just a notch above all the other angels out there in the indie rock choir, and it makes sense, though no longer practicing evangelicals, Collin and Kyle grew up singing besides their parents in their church choir, so their keen sense of harmony is nothing new to them, but instead a life practice devoted to the voice as an instrument. <br><br>The result is Bell House, and the result is beautiful. There is something sensitive to the touch about this album, which is perhaps another way of saying that, well - Shy Boys are indeed Shy Boys. I envision the band as a solid unit, with each moving part as an equal. There is a heavy sense of family in everything they do both, literally and figuratively. Bruce Springsteen''s 1980 song “Highway Patrolman” always seems to come to mind; <br><br>"Yeah me and Franky out laughing and drinking, <br>Nothing feels better than blood on blood." <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Polyvinyl Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks)', '22:23', '53.7 / 136 / 247 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/3nyji7ju6uir/Shy_Boys_-_Bell_House_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-07 20:19:48.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-07 17:19:48', '2018-08-07 17:19:48'),

Gulp are on a journey, a state of perpetual transition. The band make mini Kraut-pop epics, informed equally by the sun flares of the Californian desert and the drizzle of pure, sweet Scottish rain and northern light. Debut album ‘Season Sun’ was a home-grown delight, a ramshackle, endlessly inventive selection of dreamy psychedelic nuggets to watch the world flash past.<br><br>New album ‘All Good Wishes’ half-inches its title from a vintage Scottish postcard, and it’s emblematic of the changes the pair have undergone. “I think all through making this record we were looking at relocating,” Guto explains. “Whereas the first record was more of a road trip this is possibly a bit more focussed on home, and focussed on where we’re from and where we’re looking to go to. It’s partly a farewell to Wales, and hello to Scotland.”<br><br>The record was largely built in South Wales, a three-year process that saw the band retreat to their basement for endless sonic incisions and revisions. A broader, wider, perhaps bolder experience than their debut, ‘All Good Wishes’ is rooted in fantastic pop songwriting, in creating three minute vignettes that express complex ideas in a simple, accessible, endlessly fascinating way. Endlessly restrained yet infinitely open, each Gulp track is like a world in miniature, ideas borrowed from Krautrock and electronic culture slimmed down into these infinitely enjoyable pop songs.<br><br>Minimalist Kraut-pop with a dreamy, Cocteau Twins esque vibe, recent single ‘Morning Velvet Sky’ was a potent introduction to the duo’s ever-shifting realm.

Rollin'' With the Flow', '<!--QuoteEBegin-->Four years after releasing their Merge debut, Frozen Letter, Spider Bags have returned with Someday Everything Will Be Fine, an LP that ascends to new levels of aural punch and perspective. The years that elapsed between records were crucial in enabling that progress to take place. “We had gone as far as we could go with touring all the time, and cranking out singles and our own records,” says frontman Dan McGee, reflecting on the prolific touring and recording pace he and his bandmates have kept up since 2007. “I really wanted to see what would happen if we were just concentrating on material instead of preparing for shows. We were really able to focus on maybe 12, 14 songs—knowing we were going to have to bring them down to 10—and I think it’s a better record for it. We rehearsed ‘My Heart Is a Flame in Reverse’ and ‘Reckless’ for a year before we recorded them. That’s not something we’ve ever had the time to do before.” Recorded in Memphis at Bunker Audio by Andrew McCalla (who also engineered Spider Bags’ seminal 2012 rock and roll party record Shake my Head), Someday Everything Will Be Fine leverages the limitations and glory of the Tascam 388, a vintage recording/mixing device that’s acquired a mythos via its association with legendary records by Dinosaur Jr., East River Pipe, the Black Keys, Ty Segall, and Thee Oh Sees to name a few. The Tascam’s charms are more immediate, with a visceral resonance all its own. “It’s an 8-track machine designed for smaller studios, so your eight tracks are on quarter-inch tape. It squashes the tracks so close together they bleed into each other, which, you know, shouldn’t work, but it does. There’s also a certain compression that happens on those machines that cannot be duplicated. It feels live, but it also sounds like it took place in a studio. It’s not about being an analog purist—it’s about finding the medium that works best for what you’re trying to create, and the band has never sounded better than we sound on this record. I wanted to do as much as we could live, the four of us together playing the guitar solos and tripping effects on the fly like we would at a show. I wanted to capture the performance without the use of infinite tracks and the ability to click away mistakes. You have to be well rehearsed to make a record that way. The album is almost entirely first takes. ‘Burning Sand’ is not only a first take but also the first time we played the song all the way through, with a minute-long instrumental opening that was completely off the cuff. That’s how my favorite rock and roll records were made. It’s the limitations, I think, that create the performance.” Recording in Memphis also lent its own mojo to the album’s sound and feel. According to McGee, “Rock and roll just sounds better there.

To me, that roughly means "the stuff from which stuff generates." It''s a short hand way of evoking all the elements that I''m mashing up in this music. The idea is basically that it''s this collision of genres, and collision of different versions of "American music." It''s also an album that doesn''t fit very neatly into a category of album — studio? live? remix? Maybe all, or none, of the above. This is a new mutant variety of Elephant Micah, better suited to survive the cultural climate of the moment in so-called "Trump''s America." It lives! I guess the lodestone in the process of making this was the kind of global avant garde mood that''s prevalent in a lot of 1980s albums I admire. Things like Joni Mitchell''s Dog Eat Dog and Arthur Russell''s Calling Out of Context. These records where singers were making really eclectic and outward looking productions — writing *through* the process of recording, and literally *play- ing* with technologies that were totally new to them. All the gear that I gathered to make the album was basically discarded or devalued. I got a bunch of stuff from Craigslist that interested me: a cheap FM synth, some Hindustani electronics, and an old three-head tape deck to use as a "poor man''s space echo." The icing on the cake is a one-of-a-kind home- made digital synthesizer called "The Mutant". I worked with my brother to design it. He built it and coded it. The concept of the synth is parallel to the concept of the album itself. It''s an electronic take on "folk" sounds (bends, drones, modal playing) and folk creative approaches (a cobbling together and reformatting of existing elements).<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Western Vinyl', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks)', '32:07', '74.6 / 136 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/n1k81xrhxhpn/Elephant_Micah_-_Genericana_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-07 20:21:17.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-07 17:21:18', '2018-08-07 17:21:18'),

Schubert began this composition in August 1824, or possibly even as late as March 1825. Most of the work on it took place in the summer of 1825, during the longest journey of his life. It took him from Vienna via Linz, Steyr, Gmunden (where he found the scenery "truly heavenly"), Salzburg and then up to Bad Gastein, where he saw some magnificent alpine peaks. The first page of the score manuscript is dated "March 1828" – possibly the month in which he finally completed the work. On November 19 of that same year, Schubert died at the age of only thirty-one.

Possibly it was the high regard in which he held the genre that for so long stopped him from actually completing a quartet of his own – although he had first seriously considered writing one in 1828, it took almost 15 years before he was ready to fully commit to the idea. Once he had done so, there was no returning: during some hectic summer weeks in 1842, a year which is often called ‘Schumann''s chamber music year’, he completed the three string quartets of his Op. 41, presenting them to his wife Clara on her 23rd birthday in September. In her diary she wrote ‘… they delighted me to the utmost. Everything in them is new, clear, expertly worked out and always idiomatic.’ <br><br>The Op.41 quartets were to be the only ones from Schumann''s pen, but this is not to suggest that he was dissatisfied with them: in 1847 he wrote to his publisher that he regarded the quartets ‘as my best work from earlier times’. They are here performed by the Norwegian Engegård Quartet, whose latest release on BIS, of quartets by Grieg and Sibelius, has received critical acclaim, for instance in Gramophone: ‘Those seeking the Grieg/Sibelius pairing in modern sound would be hard pressed to find better.’ <br><br>Schumann gave the three quartets to Clara for her 23rd birthday on 13th September 1842. In the couple’s shared diary she noted: ‘The gift of his three quartets – which he arranged to be performed for me... that very evening... – brought me the greatest joy. About the quartets, all I can say is that they delighted me to the utmost. Everything in them is new, clear, expertly worked out and always idiomatic.’ The fact that Schumann wrote no more string quartets does not indicate that he was dissatisfied with them: in 1847 he wrote to his publisher Härtel that he still regarded the quartets ‘as my best work from earlier times’. And posterity has unanimously shared the view of the eminent Viennese critic Eduard Hanslick that the three Op. 41 quartets ‘are among the all-time jewels of chamber music’.

He’s wildly poetic, especially when recounting his dedication to music, and the work that led to this particular collection of delicately passionate songs. “These things became the vehicle by which we traveled, giving us reason to spend most of our lives in a van of uncertainty.” <br><br>Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread is the follow up to 2016’s Mowing — the first record he released under his own name, after fronting psych folk projects Page France and Cotton Jones — June 2017’s Some Twist, and its extension, The Load EP. The sprawling new album was recorded in Benny Yurco’s one-bedroom apartment in downtown Burlington, Vermont. Nau and his collaborators had a cool little set up going in Yurco’s spot — drums and bass took over the bedroom, the guitar amp in the bathroom, Nau’s vocals and piano in the living room, and a vibraphone in the kitchen. It’s the first time one of Nau’s records happened all in one place, and it feels most like a band record than ever before, he says; Nau and this particular group of musicians held it down together as a true team, which is why Nau named the record in their honor. Nothing more was added to it than what was recorded by Nau and the band in Yurco’s apartment. It didn’t feel like the right thing to do to mess with it post-facto, he adds. “It’s a documented live performance. It happened the way it happened, and that’s how it is.” <br><br>You can hear that organicness all across Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread, from the golden-sounding, glibly existential love song “Less Than Positive,” one of the oldest written on album, to the smoky and melancholic “Smudge,” one of the most recent compositions. “It wasn’t until recently that I ever considered revisiting songs from so long ago,” Nau says of playing songs he wrote ages ago, like “Less Than Positive.” “But something happened where I’m now able to appreciate the distance between those songs written long ago, and where I’m at now. It feels like playing someone else’s song.” Nau stresses this theme of time and distance in talking about the record. And those metaphysical thoughts permeate the music, which hangs in an ageless space, somehow classic-sounding and fresh like a cold wind, at the same time. <br><br>The songs on this layered record sound sunny and familiar, like sharing stories and worries with a close friend on a late summer day. In a gorgeous and natural way, he contemplates his own process, those feelings of uncertainty. “Making it too hard just comes easier,” Nau croons on “Funny In Real Life,” an exquisite meditation on creation and self. “Truth is such a beautiful force/And every time we find the chorus/There’s no second-guessing the real/I don’t ever know how I feel.” <br><br>Nau shines when he’s nestled in that medium between melancholy and carefree. He seems to be thinking about the past, present, and future, all at the same time, and his songs move between pain and joy, fires and rivers, faraway stars, icy Saturdays, clouds of smoke, between shelter and flowers in the rain. “And it just keeps going, if it’s done it’s done/Still flow in the flowing, all around the sun,” he sings on “Smudge,” the record’s finale, which is about love, and memories, and loneliness, and apprehension — “Something coming around some bend/Waiting for something to never end” — all at once. It’s all just part of the waves of life; sometimes you get stuck, or things move slower, and sometimes the pace steps up. And that seems to be the gist of Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread — that there are “different movements” in the self, that constantly figuring yourself out is all part of the journey. “As long as love is the motion,” Nau says, “it might get there.” Wherever there is. <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Full Time Hobby', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks)', '40:44', '95.8 / 238 / 436 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/plcnv59i4uzg/Michael_Nau_and_the_Mighty_Thread_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-08 20:18:14.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-08 17:18:14', '2018-08-08 17:18:14'),

Guitarist and lead vocalist Jeremy Stephens, fiddle player Corrina Rose Logston Stephens, and banjo player Kurt Stephenson assembled a list of decades-old songs that they could flawlessly recreate on stage, including some gems from the Stanley Brothers.

With that newfound perspective, High Fidelity handily won that year''s contest.<br><br>To all but the most dyed-in-the-wool bluegrass and old-time music devotees, the music on High Fidelity''s Rebel Records debut ''Hills And Home'' will come as a revelation.

The band also mines gems from lesser known  but no less worthy  acts such as the Lilly Brothers &amp; Don Stover, Wade Mainer, Jim &amp; Jesse, and the Country Gentlemen.<br><br>High Fidelity wooed fans and industry professionals alike when they mounted the stage of last year''s International Bluegrass Music Association showcase.

Comprised of brothers Collin and Kyle Rausch and best friends Konnor Ervin, Kyle Little and Ross Brown, Shy Boys are the heartland’s answer to The Beach Boys had Alex Chilton been on guitar. <br><br>But if a harmony falls into a microphone in the middle of America does anyone really hear it? Some do. Take for instance Shy Boys’ 2014 self-titled debut on local Kansas City label, High Dive Records - I first came across this album while living in Los Angeles and catching wind of a band from my home town that I was told could "actually sing," and after the first spin, through the muddy fidelity, man, could they actually sing. <br><br>Shy Boys’ history isn''t too dissimilar from any other Midwestern band. Like the many Replacements or Husker Düs before them - they exist neither here nor there, but instead, somewhere anonymously in the middle. And though you may not find the same opportunity floating in the middle as one would Here or There, you are allotted a certain amount of time and space to grow both yourself and your craft into what you want it to be. Over the past four years, that is exactly what Shy Boys have done and that is what brings us here today. <br><br>On August 3, 2018, the world will see the release of their second record, Bell House, out on legendary and globally cherished record label Polyvinyl, bringing both their profile and music to the surface for the first time. <br><br>The album’s title is taken from the band’s beloved headquarters - the old house on Bell Street in Kansas City where they lived together for the better part of 5 years. <br><br>“‘Lived’ is a loose term,” says lead songwriter Collin. “It was more like a bum den than anything else. There was a giant hole in the floor of the kitchen that had a piece of plywood over it. In the backyard, weeds got like 6 feet high in the summer. It was its own thriving biome. We lived in trash.” <br><br>Musically, Collin describes the songs on Bell House taking shape through “a group of guys trying to get through some sort of mutual identity crisis. The lifestyle became overwhelming and really seeped into the music.” <br><br>In the time since the release of ST, Collin saw himself falling in love and getting married, leaving the old house on Bell Street, and moving back into his mom’s house with his wife in a suburb of the city. It''s here where the songs of Bell House were born. Being back under the same roof he had grown up in where there was “still writing on the walls from childhood," Rausch found himself reflective and looking out at his life as a whole. <br><br>Take closing track “Champion” for instance, a song Collin says is dedicated to his and Kyle’s mother. “It’s just a note saying that she took care of us when we were young, and now it’s time for us to be there and take care of her.” <br><br>The reflective spirit sprinkled throughout the album is also evident on lead single, “Take The Doggie,” a bouncy, guitar driven track centered around wanting to secretly rescue their neighbor’s dog from an abusive owner, or on album highlight “Evil Sin,” which tackles the memory of drummer/bassist Konnor Ervin getting robbed. <br><br>But through all of this, Rausch kept his passion in his band, if even for nothing more than to - in his own words - have an excuse to keep hanging out with his brother and best friends. <br><br>“I have to keep Shy Boys alive to have a regular excuse to hang out with them,” says Collin. “To keep the band alive, I have to write songs. To be able to travel with my buddies, there has to be a new record.” <br><br>There is an old term that''s kicked around in country music called a "blood harmony" - in which two people in the same blood line, usually siblings, harmonize with one another in real time. Perhaps that is Shy Boys’ magic touch, putting them just a notch above all the other angels out there in the indie rock choir, and it makes sense, though no longer practicing evangelicals, Collin and Kyle grew up singing besides their parents in their church choir, so their keen sense of harmony is nothing new to them, but instead a life practice devoted to the voice as an instrument. <br><br>The result is Bell House, and the result is beautiful. There is something sensitive to the touch about this album, which is perhaps another way of saying that, well - Shy Boys are indeed Shy Boys. I envision the band as a solid unit, with each moving part as an equal. There is a heavy sense of family in everything they do both, literally and figuratively. Bruce Springsteen''s 1980 song “Highway Patrolman” always seems to come to mind; <br><br>"Yeah me and Franky out laughing and drinking, <br>Nothing feels better than blood on blood." <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Polyvinyl Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks)', '22:23', '53.7 / 136 / 247 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/3nyji7ju6uir/Shy_Boys_-_Bell_House_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-08 20:19:49.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-08 17:19:49', '2018-08-08 17:19:49'),

He began his professional career as a musician in 1967 when he was recruited to join The Tennors, a vocal group who had already scored a big hit with "Pressure And The Slide" on Coxsone''s Studio One label. The group scored another massive hit in 1968 with "Ride Your Donkey" with more hits following in 1973 when Ronnie led the group on "Weather Report" for Duke Reid''s Treasure Isle label and "Take Heed" for Bunny Lee. Both records sold well, and with encouragement from Bunny Lee, Ronnie left the group to pursue a solo career. During the mid-''70s Ronnie was among the most prolific of Jamaica''s vocalists, recording over 100 titles for a variety of labels and producers including a large body of work for Bunny Lee. By the late ''70s Davis was producing his own work for release on his own On Top label while continuing to work for other producers. He bonded with producer Lloyd Campbell who released some of Davis'' best work on the Spider Man label and included "Won''t You Come Home" which became a minor hit due in part to the superb rhythm track from The Revolutionaires.

They added a third singer, Lloyd Ricketts, and Campbell and continued recording.

Gulp are on a journey, a state of perpetual transition. The band make mini Kraut-pop epics, informed equally by the sun flares of the Californian desert and the drizzle of pure, sweet Scottish rain and northern light. Debut album ‘Season Sun’ was a home-grown delight, a ramshackle, endlessly inventive selection of dreamy psychedelic nuggets to watch the world flash past.<br><br>New album ‘All Good Wishes’ half-inches its title from a vintage Scottish postcard, and it’s emblematic of the changes the pair have undergone. “I think all through making this record we were looking at relocating,” Guto explains. “Whereas the first record was more of a road trip this is possibly a bit more focussed on home, and focussed on where we’re from and where we’re looking to go to. It’s partly a farewell to Wales, and hello to Scotland.”<br><br>The record was largely built in South Wales, a three-year process that saw the band retreat to their basement for endless sonic incisions and revisions. A broader, wider, perhaps bolder experience than their debut, ‘All Good Wishes’ is rooted in fantastic pop songwriting, in creating three minute vignettes that express complex ideas in a simple, accessible, endlessly fascinating way. Endlessly restrained yet infinitely open, each Gulp track is like a world in miniature, ideas borrowed from Krautrock and electronic culture slimmed down into these infinitely enjoyable pop songs.<br><br>Minimalist Kraut-pop with a dreamy, Cocteau Twins esque vibe, recent single ‘Morning Velvet Sky’ was a potent introduction to the duo’s ever-shifting realm. Following on from introductory cut ‘Search For Your Love’ - released on Tim Burgess’ esteemed O Genesis label - ‘Morning Velvet Sky’ was mixed by Luke Abbott, and the producer cast his eye over the record as a whole during the final mixdown in his home studio in Norwich<br><br>From Cardiff to Norwich and onwards to the Scottish East Coast, Gulp are tracing sonic ley-lines, empowering themselves, plugging into often over-looked artistic communities to fuel their next move. “We spent a lot of time on road trips listening to music, experiencing and enjoying different landscapes” he explains. “It’s especially apt in these times to see the good side of human nature; despite what the media portrays, people are generally sound, and it’s great be reminded of that in day-to-day living.<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'E.L.K.

Rollin'' With the Flow', '<!--QuoteEBegin-->Four years after releasing their Merge debut, Frozen Letter, Spider Bags have returned with Someday Everything Will Be Fine, an LP that ascends to new levels of aural punch and perspective. The years that elapsed between records were crucial in enabling that progress to take place. “We had gone as far as we could go with touring all the time, and cranking out singles and our own records,” says frontman Dan McGee, reflecting on the prolific touring and recording pace he and his bandmates have kept up since 2007. “I really wanted to see what would happen if we were just concentrating on material instead of preparing for shows. We were really able to focus on maybe 12, 14 songs—knowing we were going to have to bring them down to 10—and I think it’s a better record for it. We rehearsed ‘My Heart Is a Flame in Reverse’ and ‘Reckless’ for a year before we recorded them. That’s not something we’ve ever had the time to do before.” Recorded in Memphis at Bunker Audio by Andrew McCalla (who also engineered Spider Bags’ seminal 2012 rock and roll party record Shake my Head), Someday Everything Will Be Fine leverages the limitations and glory of the Tascam 388, a vintage recording/mixing device that’s acquired a mythos via its association with legendary records by Dinosaur Jr., East River Pipe, the Black Keys, Ty Segall, and Thee Oh Sees to name a few. The Tascam’s charms are more immediate, with a visceral resonance all its own. “It’s an 8-track machine designed for smaller studios, so your eight tracks are on quarter-inch tape. It squashes the tracks so close together they bleed into each other, which, you know, shouldn’t work, but it does. There’s also a certain compression that happens on those machines that cannot be duplicated. It feels live, but it also sounds like it took place in a studio. It’s not about being an analog purist—it’s about finding the medium that works best for what you’re trying to create, and the band has never sounded better than we sound on this record. I wanted to do as much as we could live, the four of us together playing the guitar solos and tripping effects on the fly like we would at a show. I wanted to capture the performance without the use of infinite tracks and the ability to click away mistakes. You have to be well rehearsed to make a record that way. The album is almost entirely first takes. ‘Burning Sand’ is not only a first take but also the first time we played the song all the way through, with a minute-long instrumental opening that was completely off the cuff. That’s how my favorite rock and roll records were made. It’s the limitations, I think, that create the performance.” Recording in Memphis also lent its own mojo to the album’s sound and feel. According to McGee, “Rock and roll just sounds better there. I swear.” Adding to this sound is the featured playing of Memphis giants Jack Oblivian, John Whittemore, Jana Misener and Krista Wroten-Combest of the Memphis Dawls, and multi-instrumentalist Seth Moody. “It’s a great town with so much individuality and history, musical and otherwise, that can’t help but seep into the music you’re making. I love that city.” Other non-Spider Bag contributing musicians include Patrick Stickles of Titus Andronicus and Matthew Hoopengardner of Austin, Texas, rock and roll legends the Golden Boys. The LP opens with “Reckless,” a strangely organic-sounding sprawl wrought from different parts of songs that McGee had struggled to complete, which peaks with gorgeous guitar fireworks. “The song didn’t seem satisfied until I brought in a couple pieces from other songs I hadn’t finished,” says McGee. “Steve [Oliva, the band’s bassist] said when we finished recording it, ‘There’s seven parts in that song and none of them repeat.’” From that epic build-up, the record returns to earth with the sprightly “Oxcart Blues,” whose twinned guitars a...<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Merge Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-48kHz FLAC (tracks)', '38:27', '105 / 239 / 449 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/j9srnvv9hwu5/Someday_Everything_Will_Be_Fine_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-08 20:21:14.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-08 17:21:14', '2018-08-08 17:21:14'),

To me, that roughly means "the stuff from which stuff generates." It''s a short hand way of evoking all the elements that I''m mashing up in this music. The idea is basically that it''s this collision of genres, and collision of different versions of "American music." It''s also an album that doesn''t fit very neatly into a category of album — studio? live? remix? Maybe all, or none, of the above. This is a new mutant variety of Elephant Micah, better suited to survive the cultural climate of the moment in so-called "Trump''s America." It lives! I guess the lodestone in the process of making this was the kind of global avant garde mood that''s prevalent in a lot of 1980s albums I admire. Things like Joni Mitchell''s Dog Eat Dog and Arthur Russell''s Calling Out of Context. These records where singers were making really eclectic and outward looking productions — writing *through* the process of recording, and literally *play- ing* with technologies that were totally new to them. All the gear that I gathered to make the album was basically discarded or devalued. I got a bunch of stuff from Craigslist that interested me: a cheap FM synth, some Hindustani electronics, and an old three-head tape deck to use as a "poor man''s space echo." The icing on the cake is a one-of-a-kind home- made digital synthesizer called "The Mutant". I worked with my brother to design it. He built it and coded it. The concept of the synth is parallel to the concept of the album itself. It''s an electronic take on "folk" sounds (bends, drones, modal playing) and folk creative approaches (a cobbling together and reformatting of existing elements).<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Western Vinyl', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks)', '32:07', '74.6 / 136 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/n1k81xrhxhpn/Elephant_Micah_-_Genericana_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-08 20:21:19.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-08 17:21:19', '2018-08-08 17:21:19'),

A multi-instrumentalist who put out three albums on her own by the age of 17, the 20-year old Nantucket, Massachusetts native has penned tracks for everyone from Grammy-winning country superstars Rascal Flatts and Grammy-nominated country artist Hunter Hayes to reggae/rock/R&amp;B group Common Kings and Hot Chelle Rae singer Ryan Follesé. Recently signed to Epic Records, Meghan joined forces with Grammy-nominated producer/songwriter Kevin Kadish (Miley Cyrus, Jason Mraz) for her infectious debut single, "All About That Bass," a playful, empowering and unapologetic pop anthem that encourages girls to ignore the Barbie doll standard of beauty and love themselves inside and out.<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Epic', NULL, '24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks)', '45:57', '547 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/yl5e6mkt10tc/Meghan_Trainor_-_Title_Deluxe.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-08 20:22:16.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-08 17:22:16', '2018-08-08 17:22:16'),

Schubert began this composition in August 1824, or possibly even as late as March 1825. Most of the work on it took place in the summer of 1825, during the longest journey of his life. It took him from Vienna via Linz, Steyr, Gmunden (where he found the scenery "truly heavenly"), Salzburg and then up to Bad Gastein, where he saw some magnificent alpine peaks. The first page of the score manuscript is dated "March 1828" – possibly the month in which he finally completed the work. On November 19 of that same year, Schubert died at the age of only thirty-one. The symphony was premiered posthumously on March 21, 1839 in the Leipzig Gewandhaus, and conducted by the Gewandhaus Kapellmeister at that time - the 30-year-old Felix Mendelssohn.

But Klengel was an important early-Romantic composer and celebrated piano virtuoso, with a reputation that stretched from St Petersburg to London. This first recording of his piano and chamber music reveals a personality with a strong lyrical impulse, somewhere between Field, Mendelssohn and Chopin, all three of whom he knew personally. Founded in 2016, Trio Klengel is named after August Klengel with the purpose of promoting his works. The ensemble decided to continue the work of the original Klengel Trio, founded in 1912. This trio consisted of the three daughters of the composer Julius Klengel, a relative of August Klengel. Just like the first Klengel Trio, this ensemble is also dedicated to promoting chamber music of long-forgotten composers and their works through concerts and recording projects. <br><br>Anna Petrova, piano<br>Trio Klengel<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Toccata Classics', NULL, 'FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks+booklet)', '01:13:35', '286 / 645 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/01s4gews2se4/Trio_Klengel_-_Klengel_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-09 20:16:01.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-09 17:16:01', '2018-08-09 17:16:01');

Possibly it was the high regard in which he held the genre that for so long stopped him from actually completing a quartet of his own – although he had first seriously considered writing one in 1828, it took almost 15 years before he was ready to fully commit to the idea. Once he had done so, there was no returning: during some hectic summer weeks in 1842, a year which is often called ‘Schumann''s chamber music year’, he completed the three string quartets of his Op. 41, presenting them to his wife Clara on her 23rd birthday in September. In her diary she wrote ‘… they delighted me to the utmost. Everything in them is new, clear, expertly worked out and always idiomatic.’ <br><br>The Op.41 quartets were to be the only ones from Schumann''s pen, but this is not to suggest that he was dissatisfied with them: in 1847 he wrote to his publisher that he regarded the quartets ‘as my best work from earlier times’. They are here performed by the Norwegian Engegård Quartet, whose latest release on BIS, of quartets by Grieg and Sibelius, has received critical acclaim, for instance in Gramophone: ‘Those seeking the Grieg/Sibelius pairing in modern sound would be hard pressed to find better.’ <br><br>Schumann gave the three quartets to Clara for her 23rd birthday on 13th September 1842. In the couple’s shared diary she noted: ‘The gift of his three quartets – which he arranged to be performed for me... that very evening... – brought me the greatest joy. About the quartets, all I can say is that they delighted me to the utmost. Everything in them is new, clear, expertly worked out and always idiomatic.’ The fact that Schumann wrote no more string quartets does not indicate that he was dissatisfied with them: in 1847 he wrote to his publisher Härtel that he still regarded the quartets ‘as my best work from earlier times’. And posterity has unanimously shared the view of the eminent Viennese critic Eduard Hanslick that the three Op. 41 quartets ‘are among the all-time jewels of chamber music’.

He’s wildly poetic, especially when recounting his dedication to music, and the work that led to this particular collection of delicately passionate songs. “These things became the vehicle by which we traveled, giving us reason to spend most of our lives in a van of uncertainty.” <br><br>Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread is the follow up to 2016’s Mowing — the first record he released under his own name, after fronting psych folk projects Page France and Cotton Jones — June 2017’s Some Twist, and its extension, The Load EP. The sprawling new album was recorded in Benny Yurco’s one-bedroom apartment in downtown Burlington, Vermont. Nau and his collaborators had a cool little set up going in Yurco’s spot — drums and bass took over the bedroom, the guitar amp in the bathroom, Nau’s vocals and piano in the living room, and a vibraphone in the kitchen. It’s the first time one of Nau’s records happened all in one place, and it feels most like a band record than ever before, he says; Nau and this particular group of musicians held it down together as a true team, which is why Nau named the record in their honor. Nothing more was added to it than what was recorded by Nau and the band in Yurco’s apartment. It didn’t feel like the right thing to do to mess with it post-facto, he adds. “It’s a documented live performance. It happened the way it happened, and that’s how it is.” <br><br>You can hear that organicness all across Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread, from the golden-sounding, glibly existential love song “Less Than Positive,” one of the oldest written on album, to the smoky and melancholic “Smudge,” one of the most recent compositions. “It wasn’t until recently that I ever considered revisiting songs from so long ago,” Nau says of playing songs he wrote ages ago, like “Less Than Positive.” “But something happened where I’m now able to appreciate the distance between those songs written long ago, and where I’m at now. It feels like playing someone else’s song.” Nau stresses this theme of time and distance in talking about the record. And those metaphysical thoughts permeate the music, which hangs in an ageless space, somehow classic-sounding and fresh like a cold wind, at the same time. <br><br>The songs on this layered record sound sunny and familiar, like sharing stories and worries with a close friend on a late summer day. In a gorgeous and natural way, he contemplates his own process, those feelings of uncertainty. “Making it too hard just comes easier,” Nau croons on “Funny In Real Life,” an exquisite meditation on creation and self. “Truth is such a beautiful force/And every time we find the chorus/There’s no second-guessing the real/I don’t ever know how I feel.” <br><br>Nau shines when he’s nestled in that medium between melancholy and carefree. He seems to be thinking about the past, present, and future, all at the same time, and his songs move between pain and joy, fires and rivers, faraway stars, icy Saturdays, clouds of smoke, between shelter and flowers in the rain. “And it just keeps going, if it’s done it’s done/Still flow in the flowing, all around the sun,” he sings on “Smudge,” the record’s finale, which is about love, and memories, and loneliness, and apprehension — “Something coming around some bend/Waiting for something to never end” — all at once. It’s all just part of the waves of life; sometimes you get stuck, or things move slower, and sometimes the pace steps up. And that seems to be the gist of Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread — that there are “different movements” in the self, that constantly figuring yourself out is all part of the journey. “As long as love is the motion,” Nau says, “it might get there.” Wherever there is. <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Full Time Hobby', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks)', '40:44', '95.8 / 238 / 436 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/plcnv59i4uzg/Michael_Nau_and_the_Mighty_Thread_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-09 20:18:16.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-09 17:18:16', '2018-08-09 17:18:16');

Comprised of brothers Collin and Kyle Rausch and best friends Konnor Ervin, Kyle Little and Ross Brown, Shy Boys are the heartland’s answer to The Beach Boys had Alex Chilton been on guitar. <br><br>But if a harmony falls into a microphone in the middle of America does anyone really hear it? Some do. Take for instance Shy Boys’ 2014 self-titled debut on local Kansas City label, High Dive Records - I first came across this album while living in Los Angeles and catching wind of a band from my home town that I was told could "actually sing," and after the first spin, through the muddy fidelity, man, could they actually sing. <br><br>Shy Boys’ history isn''t too dissimilar from any other Midwestern band. Like the many Replacements or Husker Düs before them - they exist neither here nor there, but instead, somewhere anonymously in the middle. And though you may not find the same opportunity floating in the middle as one would Here or There, you are allotted a certain amount of time and space to grow both yourself and your craft into what you want it to be. Over the past four years, that is exactly what Shy Boys have done and that is what brings us here today. <br><br>On August 3, 2018, the world will see the release of their second record, Bell House, out on legendary and globally cherished record label Polyvinyl, bringing both their profile and music to the surface for the first time. <br><br>The album’s title is taken from the band’s beloved headquarters - the old house on Bell Street in Kansas City where they lived together for the better part of 5 years. <br><br>“‘Lived’ is a loose term,” says lead songwriter Collin. “It was more like a bum den than anything else. There was a giant hole in the floor of the kitchen that had a piece of plywood over it. In the backyard, weeds got like 6 feet high in the summer. It was its own thriving biome. We lived in trash.” <br><br>Musically, Collin describes the songs on Bell House taking shape through “a group of guys trying to get through some sort of mutual identity crisis. The lifestyle became overwhelming and really seeped into the music.” <br><br>In the time since the release of ST, Collin saw himself falling in love and getting married, leaving the old house on Bell Street, and moving back into his mom’s house with his wife in a suburb of the city. It''s here where the songs of Bell House were born. Being back under the same roof he had grown up in where there was “still writing on the walls from childhood," Rausch found himself reflective and looking out at his life as a whole. <br><br>Take closing track “Champion” for instance, a song Collin says is dedicated to his and Kyle’s mother. “It’s just a note saying that she took care of us when we were young, and now it’s time for us to be there and take care of her.” <br><br>The reflective spirit sprinkled throughout the album is also evident on lead single, “Take The Doggie,” a bouncy, guitar driven track centered around wanting to secretly rescue their neighbor’s dog from an abusive owner, or on album highlight “Evil Sin,” which tackles the memory of drummer/bassist Konnor Ervin getting robbed. <br><br>But through all of this, Rausch kept his passion in his band, if even for nothing more than to - in his own words - have an excuse to keep hanging out with his brother and best friends. <br><br>“I have to keep Shy Boys alive to have a regular excuse to hang out with them,” says Collin. “To keep the band alive, I have to write songs. To be able to travel with my buddies, there has to be a new record.” <br><br>There is an old term that''s kicked around in country music called a "blood harmony" - in which two people in the same blood line, usually siblings, harmonize with one another in real time. Perhaps that is Shy Boys’ magic touch, putting them just a notch above all the other angels out there in the indie rock choir, and it makes sense, though no longer practicing evangelicals, Collin and Kyle grew up singing besides their parents in their church choir, so their keen sense of harmony is nothing new to them, but instead a life practice devoted to the voice as an instrument. <br><br>The result is Bell House, and the result is beautiful.

He began his professional career as a musician in 1967 when he was recruited to join The Tennors, a vocal group who had already scored a big hit with "Pressure And The Slide" on Coxsone''s Studio One label. The group scored another massive hit in 1968 with "Ride Your Donkey" with more hits following in 1973 when Ronnie led the group on "Weather Report" for Duke Reid''s Treasure Isle label and "Take Heed" for Bunny Lee. Both records sold well, and with encouragement from Bunny Lee, Ronnie left the group to pursue a solo career. During the mid-''70s Ronnie was among the most prolific of Jamaica''s vocalists, recording over 100 titles for a variety of labels and producers including a large body of work for Bunny Lee. By the late ''70s Davis was producing his own work for release on his own On Top label while continuing to work for other producers. He bonded with producer Lloyd Campbell who released some of Davis'' best work on the Spider Man label and included "Won''t You Come Home" which became a minor hit due in part to the superb rhythm track from The Revolutionaires. Ronnie loved this record, and soon returned to Lloyd Campbell with Keith Porter, a friend from Savannah La Mar who had written a new song for the rhythm. Together they cut "In A Dis A Time" with Keith leading the fierce Rastafarian classic with sweet harmony from Ronnie. The song, credited to The Itals, became a massive local hit. They added a third singer, Lloyd Ricketts, and Campbell and continued recording. In late 1979, Robert Schoenfeld and Leroy Jodie Pierson of Nighthawk Records began searching for The Itals and after tracking them down, they found themselves gathered at Aquarius Studio listening to superb Spider Man tracks by the group. A few days later, Keith Porter, Lloyd Ricketts and Ronnie Davis auditioned songs for their very first album, Brutal Out Deh. The group was signed to a five-year contract and began work on their album. Robert Palmer wrote a rave review published in the weekend edition of the New York Times, and sales exploded.

Gulp are on a journey, a state of perpetual transition. The band make mini Kraut-pop epics, informed equally by the sun flares of the Californian desert and the drizzle of pure, sweet Scottish rain and northern light. Debut album ‘Season Sun’ was a home-grown delight, a ramshackle, endlessly inventive selection of dreamy psychedelic nuggets to watch the world flash past.<br><br>New album ‘All Good Wishes’ half-inches its title from a vintage Scottish postcard, and it’s emblematic of the changes the pair have undergone. “I think all through making this record we were looking at relocating,” Guto explains. “Whereas the first record was more of a road trip this is possibly a bit more focussed on home, and focussed on where we’re from and where we’re looking to go to. It’s partly a farewell to Wales, and hello to Scotland.”<br><br>The record was largely built in South Wales, a three-year process that saw the band retreat to their basement for endless sonic incisions and revisions. A broader, wider, perhaps bolder experience than their debut, ‘All Good Wishes’ is rooted in fantastic pop songwriting, in creating three minute vignettes that express complex ideas in a simple, accessible, endlessly fascinating way. Endlessly restrained yet infinitely open, each Gulp track is like a world in miniature, ideas borrowed from Krautrock and electronic culture slimmed down into these infinitely enjoyable pop songs.<br><br>Minimalist Kraut-pop with a dreamy, Cocteau Twins esque vibe, recent single ‘Morning Velvet Sky’ was a potent introduction to the duo’s ever-shifting realm.

Rollin'' With the Flow', '<!--QuoteEBegin-->Four years after releasing their Merge debut, Frozen Letter, Spider Bags have returned with Someday Everything Will Be Fine, an LP that ascends to new levels of aural punch and perspective. The years that elapsed between records were crucial in enabling that progress to take place. “We had gone as far as we could go with touring all the time, and cranking out singles and our own records,” says frontman Dan McGee, reflecting on the prolific touring and recording pace he and his bandmates have kept up since 2007. “I really wanted to see what would happen if we were just concentrating on material instead of preparing for shows. We were really able to focus on maybe 12, 14 songs—knowing we were going to have to bring them down to 10—and I think it’s a better record for it. We rehearsed ‘My Heart Is a Flame in Reverse’ and ‘Reckless’ for a year before we recorded them. That’s not something we’ve ever had the time to do before.” Recorded in Memphis at Bunker Audio by Andrew McCalla (who also engineered Spider Bags’ seminal 2012 rock and roll party record Shake my Head), Someday Everything Will Be Fine leverages the limitations and glory of the Tascam 388, a vintage recording/mixing device that’s acquired a mythos via its association with legendary records by Dinosaur Jr., East River Pipe, the Black Keys, Ty Segall, and Thee Oh Sees to name a few. The Tascam’s charms are more immediate, with a visceral resonance all its own. “It’s an 8-track machine designed for smaller studios, so your eight tracks are on quarter-inch tape. It squashes the tracks so close together they bleed into each other, which, you know, shouldn’t work, but it does. There’s also a certain compression that happens on those machines that cannot be duplicated. It feels live, but it also sounds like it took place in a studio. It’s not about being an analog purist—it’s about finding the medium that works best for what you’re trying to create, and the band has never sounded better than we sound on this record. I wanted to do as much as we could live, the four of us together playing the guitar solos and tripping effects on the fly like we would at a show. I wanted to capture the performance without the use of infinite tracks and the ability to click away mistakes. You have to be well rehearsed to make a record that way. The album is almost entirely first takes. ‘Burning Sand’ is not only a first take but also the first time we played the song all the way through, with a minute-long instrumental opening that was completely off the cuff. That’s how my favorite rock and roll records were made. It’s the limitations, I think, that create the performance.” Recording in Memphis also lent its own mojo to the album’s sound and feel. According to McGee, “Rock and roll just sounds better there. I swear.” Adding to this sound is the featured playing of Memphis giants Jack Oblivian, John Whittemore, Jana Misener and Krista Wroten-Combest of the Memphis Dawls, and multi-instrumentalist Seth Moody. “It’s a great town with so much individuality and history, musical and otherwise, that can’t help but seep into the music you’re making. I love that city.” Other non-Spider Bag contributing musicians include Patrick Stickles of Titus Andronicus and Matthew Hoopengardner of Austin, Texas, rock and roll legends the Golden Boys. The LP opens with “Reckless,” a strangely organic-sounding sprawl wrought from different parts of songs that McGee had struggled to complete, which peaks with gorgeous guitar fireworks. “The song didn’t seem satisfied until I brought in a couple pieces from other songs I hadn’t finished,” says McGee. “Steve [Oliva, the band’s bassist] said when we finished recording it, ‘There’s seven parts in that song and none of them repeat.’” From that epic build-up, the record returns to earth with the sprightly “Oxcart Blues,” whose twinned guitars a...<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Merge Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-48kHz FLAC (tracks)', '38:27', '105 / 239 / 449 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/j9srnvv9hwu5/Someday_Everything_Will_Be_Fine_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-09 20:21:13.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-09 17:21:13', '2018-08-09 17:21:13'),

To me, that roughly means "the stuff from which stuff generates." It''s a short hand way of evoking all the elements that I''m mashing up in this music. The idea is basically that it''s this collision of genres, and collision of different versions of "American music." It''s also an album that doesn''t fit very neatly into a category of album — studio? live? remix? Maybe all, or none, of the above. This is a new mutant variety of Elephant Micah, better suited to survive the cultural climate of the moment in so-called "Trump''s America." It lives! I guess the lodestone in the process of making this was the kind of global avant garde mood that''s prevalent in a lot of 1980s albums I admire. Things like Joni Mitchell''s Dog Eat Dog and Arthur Russell''s Calling Out of Context. These records where singers were making really eclectic and outward looking productions — writing *through* the process of recording, and literally *play- ing* with technologies that were totally new to them. All the gear that I gathered to make the album was basically discarded or devalued. I got a bunch of stuff from Craigslist that interested me: a cheap FM synth, some Hindustani electronics, and an old three-head tape deck to use as a "poor man''s space echo." The icing on the cake is a one-of-a-kind home- made digital synthesizer called "The Mutant". I worked with my brother to design it. He built it and coded it. The concept of the synth is parallel to the concept of the album itself. It''s an electronic take on "folk" sounds (bends, drones, modal playing) and folk creative approaches (a cobbling together and reformatting of existing elements).<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Western Vinyl', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks)', '32:07', '74.6 / 136 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/n1k81xrhxhpn/Elephant_Micah_-_Genericana_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-09 20:21:18.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-09 17:21:19', '2018-08-09 17:21:19'),

Schubert began this composition in August 1824, or possibly even as late as March 1825. Most of the work on it took place in the summer of 1825, during the longest journey of his life. It took him from Vienna via Linz, Steyr, Gmunden (where he found the scenery "truly heavenly"), Salzburg and then up to Bad Gastein, where he saw some magnificent alpine peaks. The first page of the score manuscript is dated "March 1828" – possibly the month in which he finally completed the work. On November 19 of that same year, Schubert died at the age of only thirty-one. The symphony was premiered posthumously on March 21, 1839 in the Leipzig Gewandhaus, and conducted by the Gewandhaus Kapellmeister at that time - the 30-year-old Felix Mendelssohn.

Possibly it was the high regard in which he held the genre that for so long stopped him from actually completing a quartet of his own – although he had first seriously considered writing one in 1828, it took almost 15 years before he was ready to fully commit to the idea. Once he had done so, there was no returning: during some hectic summer weeks in 1842, a year which is often called ‘Schumann''s chamber music year’, he completed the three string quartets of his Op. 41, presenting them to his wife Clara on her 23rd birthday in September. In her diary she wrote ‘… they delighted me to the utmost. Everything in them is new, clear, expertly worked out and always idiomatic.’ <br><br>The Op.41 quartets were to be the only ones from Schumann''s pen, but this is not to suggest that he was dissatisfied with them: in 1847 he wrote to his publisher that he regarded the quartets ‘as my best work from earlier times’. They are here performed by the Norwegian Engegård Quartet, whose latest release on BIS, of quartets by Grieg and Sibelius, has received critical acclaim, for instance in Gramophone: ‘Those seeking the Grieg/Sibelius pairing in modern sound would be hard pressed to find better.’ <br><br>Schumann gave the three quartets to Clara for her 23rd birthday on 13th September 1842. In the couple’s shared diary she noted: ‘The gift of his three quartets – which he arranged to be performed for me... that very evening... – brought me the greatest joy. About the quartets, all I can say is that they delighted me to the utmost. Everything in them is new, clear, expertly worked out and always idiomatic.’ The fact that Schumann wrote no more string quartets does not indicate that he was dissatisfied with them: in 1847 he wrote to his publisher Härtel that he still regarded the quartets ‘as my best work from earlier times’. And posterity has unanimously shared the view of the eminent Viennese critic Eduard Hanslick that the three Op. 41 quartets ‘are among the all-time jewels of chamber music’.

But as the Danish accordionist Andreas Borregaard writes in his own liner notes to this disc: ‘the Goldberg Variations are so much more than a gigantic, sounding sudoku. Each variation is an expressive universe unto itself, and the music passes through almost every corner of the human spectrum of emotions.’ <br><br>Originally written for the harpsichord, the work has become part of the piano repertoire, but the emotional range that Borregaard emphasizes is perhaps brought out even more clearly when it is performed, as here, on the accordion. The inherent nostalgia of the Aria is more poignant than ever, the gigue in Variation 7 has the swagger of sailors on shore leave, and the introspection of Variation 15 is almost hypnotic. <br><br>Andreas Borregaard, accordion <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'BIS', NULL, 'FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-48kHz FLAC (tracks+booklet)', '01:29:51', '443 / 935 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/z4i12u3rthzd/Andreas_Borregaard_-_Bach_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-10 20:16:20.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-10 17:16:21', '2018-08-10 17:16:21');

Repin won his first competition at the age of five, and at 17, he was the youngest ever winner of the prestigious Queen Elisabeth Competition. This is Repin’s first commercial release of the FIrst Violin Concerto This performance of Chout is narrated in English by stage and screen legend Simon Callow. Callow brings to life the story of a buffoon who, through many tricks and deceptions, outwits seven other buffoons. This release includes the full score of the 1921 ballet Chout. The full ballet is rarely performed and has only been recorded a handful of times in its history, with the first ever recording in 1985. Alexander Lazarev has been praised for his interpretations of Prokofiev.

He’s wildly poetic, especially when recounting his dedication to music, and the work that led to this particular collection of delicately passionate songs. “These things became the vehicle by which we traveled, giving us reason to spend most of our lives in a van of uncertainty.” <br><br>Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread is the follow up to 2016’s Mowing — the first record he released under his own name, after fronting psych folk projects Page France and Cotton Jones — June 2017’s Some Twist, and its extension, The Load EP. The sprawling new album was recorded in Benny Yurco’s one-bedroom apartment in downtown Burlington, Vermont. Nau and his collaborators had a cool little set up going in Yurco’s spot — drums and bass took over the bedroom, the guitar amp in the bathroom, Nau’s vocals and piano in the living room, and a vibraphone in the kitchen. It’s the first time one of Nau’s records happened all in one place, and it feels most like a band record than ever before, he says; Nau and this particular group of musicians held it down together as a true team, which is why Nau named the record in their honor. Nothing more was added to it than what was recorded by Nau and the band in Yurco’s apartment. It didn’t feel like the right thing to do to mess with it post-facto, he adds. “It’s a documented live performance. It happened the way it happened, and that’s how it is.” <br><br>You can hear that organicness all across Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread, from the golden-sounding, glibly existential love song “Less Than Positive,” one of the oldest written on album, to the smoky and melancholic “Smudge,” one of the most recent compositions. “It wasn’t until recently that I ever considered revisiting songs from so long ago,” Nau says of playing songs he wrote ages ago, like “Less Than Positive.” “But something happened where I’m now able to appreciate the distance between those songs written long ago, and where I’m at now. It feels like playing someone else’s song.” Nau stresses this theme of time and distance in talking about the record. And those metaphysical thoughts permeate the music, which hangs in an ageless space, somehow classic-sounding and fresh like a cold wind, at the same time. <br><br>The songs on this layered record sound sunny and familiar, like sharing stories and worries with a close friend on a late summer day. In a gorgeous and natural way, he contemplates his own process, those feelings of uncertainty. “Making it too hard just comes easier,” Nau croons on “Funny In Real Life,” an exquisite meditation on creation and self. “Truth is such a beautiful force/And every time we find the chorus/There’s no second-guessing the real/I don’t ever know how I feel.” <br><br>Nau shines when he’s nestled in that medium between melancholy and carefree. He seems to be thinking about the past, present, and future, all at the same time, and his songs move between pain and joy, fires and rivers, faraway stars, icy Saturdays, clouds of smoke, between shelter and flowers in the rain. “And it just keeps going, if it’s done it’s done/Still flow in the flowing, all around the sun,” he sings on “Smudge,” the record’s finale, which is about love, and memories, and loneliness, and apprehension — “Something coming around some bend/Waiting for something to never end” — all at once. It’s all just part of the waves of life; sometimes you get stuck, or things move slower, and sometimes the pace steps up. And that seems to be the gist of Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread — that there are “different movements” in the self, that constantly figuring yourself out is all part of the journey. “As long as love is the motion,” Nau says, “it might get there.” Wherever there is. <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Full Time Hobby', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks)', '40:44', '95.8 / 238 / 436 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/plcnv59i4uzg/Michael_Nau_and_the_Mighty_Thread_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-10 20:18:13.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-10 17:18:14', '2018-08-10 17:18:14'),

Comprised of brothers Collin and Kyle Rausch and best friends Konnor Ervin, Kyle Little and Ross Brown, Shy Boys are the heartland’s answer to The Beach Boys had Alex Chilton been on guitar. <br><br>But if a harmony falls into a microphone in the middle of America does anyone really hear it? Some do. Take for instance Shy Boys’ 2014 self-titled debut on local Kansas City label, High Dive Records - I first came across this album while living in Los Angeles and catching wind of a band from my home town that I was told could "actually sing," and after the first spin, through the muddy fidelity, man, could they actually sing. <br><br>Shy Boys’ history isn''t too dissimilar from any other Midwestern band. Like the many Replacements or Husker Düs before them - they exist neither here nor there, but instead, somewhere anonymously in the middle. And though you may not find the same opportunity floating in the middle as one would Here or There, you are allotted a certain amount of time and space to grow both yourself and your craft into what you want it to be. Over the past four years, that is exactly what Shy Boys have done and that is what brings us here today. <br><br>On August 3, 2018, the world will see the release of their second record, Bell House, out on legendary and globally cherished record label Polyvinyl, bringing both their profile and music to the surface for the first time. <br><br>The album’s title is taken from the band’s beloved headquarters - the old house on Bell Street in Kansas City where they lived together for the better part of 5 years. <br><br>“‘Lived’ is a loose term,” says lead songwriter Collin. “It was more like a bum den than anything else. There was a giant hole in the floor of the kitchen that had a piece of plywood over it. In the backyard, weeds got like 6 feet high in the summer. It was its own thriving biome. We lived in trash.” <br><br>Musically, Collin describes the songs on Bell House taking shape through “a group of guys trying to get through some sort of mutual identity crisis. The lifestyle became overwhelming and really seeped into the music.” <br><br>In the time since the release of ST, Collin saw himself falling in love and getting married, leaving the old house on Bell Street, and moving back into his mom’s house with his wife in a suburb of the city. It''s here where the songs of Bell House were born. Being back under the same roof he had grown up in where there was “still writing on the walls from childhood," Rausch found himself reflective and looking out at his life as a whole. <br><br>Take closing track “Champion” for instance, a song Collin says is dedicated to his and Kyle’s mother. “It’s just a note saying that she took care of us when we were young, and now it’s time for us to be there and take care of her.” <br><br>The reflective spirit sprinkled throughout the album is also evident on lead single, “Take The Doggie,” a bouncy, guitar driven track centered around wanting to secretly rescue their neighbor’s dog from an abusive owner, or on album highlight “Evil Sin,” which tackles the memory of drummer/bassist Konnor Ervin getting robbed. <br><br>But through all of this, Rausch kept his passion in his band, if even for nothing more than to - in his own words - have an excuse to keep hanging out with his brother and best friends. <br><br>“I have to keep Shy Boys alive to have a regular excuse to hang out with them,” says Collin. “To keep the band alive, I have to write songs. To be able to travel with my buddies, there has to be a new record.” <br><br>There is an old term that''s kicked around in country music called a "blood harmony" - in which two people in the same blood line, usually siblings, harmonize with one another in real time. Perhaps that is Shy Boys’ magic touch, putting them just a notch above all the other angels out there in the indie rock choir, and it makes sense, though no longer practicing evangelicals, Collin and Kyle grew up singing besides their parents in their church choir, so their keen sense of harmony is nothing new to them, but instead a life practice devoted to the voice as an instrument. <br><br>The result is Bell House, and the result is beautiful. There is something sensitive to the touch about this album, which is perhaps another way of saying that, well - Shy Boys are indeed Shy Boys. I envision the band as a solid unit, with each moving part as an equal. There is a heavy sense of family in everything they do both, literally and figuratively. Bruce Springsteen''s 1980 song “Highway Patrolman” always seems to come to mind; <br><br>"Yeah me and Franky out laughing and drinking, <br>Nothing feels better than blood on blood." <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Polyvinyl Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks)', '22:23', '53.7 / 136 / 247 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/3nyji7ju6uir/Shy_Boys_-_Bell_House_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-10 20:19:47.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-10 17:19:47', '2018-08-10 17:19:47'),

He began his professional career as a musician in 1967 when he was recruited to join The Tennors, a vocal group who had already scored a big hit with "Pressure And The Slide" on Coxsone''s Studio One label. The group scored another massive hit in 1968 with "Ride Your Donkey" with more hits following in 1973 when Ronnie led the group on "Weather Report" for Duke Reid''s Treasure Isle label and "Take Heed" for Bunny Lee. Both records sold well, and with encouragement from Bunny Lee, Ronnie left the group to pursue a solo career. During the mid-''70s Ronnie was among the most prolific of Jamaica''s vocalists, recording over 100 titles for a variety of labels and producers including a large body of work for Bunny Lee. By the late ''70s Davis was producing his own work for release on his own On Top label while continuing to work for other producers. He bonded with producer Lloyd Campbell who released some of Davis'' best work on the Spider Man label and included "Won''t You Come Home" which became a minor hit due in part to the superb rhythm track from The Revolutionaires. Ronnie loved this record, and soon returned to Lloyd Campbell with Keith Porter, a friend from Savannah La Mar who had written a new song for the rhythm. Together they cut "In A Dis A Time" with Keith leading the fierce Rastafarian classic with sweet harmony from Ronnie. The song, credited to The Itals, became a massive local hit. They added a third singer, Lloyd Ricketts, and Campbell and continued recording.

Debut album ‘Season Sun’ was a home-grown delight, a ramshackle, endlessly inventive selection of dreamy psychedelic nuggets to watch the world flash past.<br><br>New album ‘All Good Wishes’ half-inches its title from a vintage Scottish postcard, and it’s emblematic of the changes the pair have undergone. “I think all through making this record we were looking at relocating,” Guto explains. “Whereas the first record was more of a road trip this is possibly a bit more focussed on home, and focussed on where we’re from and where we’re looking to go to. It’s partly a farewell to Wales, and hello to Scotland.”<br><br>The record was largely built in South Wales, a three-year process that saw the band retreat to their basement for endless sonic incisions and revisions. A broader, wider, perhaps bolder experience than their debut, ‘All Good Wishes’ is rooted in fantastic pop songwriting, in creating three minute vignettes that express complex ideas in a simple, accessible, endlessly fascinating way. Endlessly restrained yet infinitely open, each Gulp track is like a world in miniature, ideas borrowed from Krautrock and electronic culture slimmed down into these infinitely enjoyable pop songs.<br><br>Minimalist Kraut-pop with a dreamy, Cocteau Twins esque vibe, recent single ‘Morning Velvet Sky’ was a potent introduction to the duo’s ever-shifting realm. Following on from introductory cut ‘Search For Your Love’ - released on Tim Burgess’ esteemed O Genesis label - ‘Morning Velvet Sky’ was mixed by Luke Abbott, and the producer cast his eye over the record as a whole during the final mixdown in his home studio in Norwich<br><br>From Cardiff to Norwich and onwards to the Scottish East Coast, Gulp are tracing sonic ley-lines, empowering themselves, plugging into often over-looked artistic communities to fuel their next move. “We spent a lot of time on road trips listening to music, experiencing and enjoying different landscapes” he explains. “It’s especially apt in these times to see the good side of human nature; despite what the media portrays, people are generally sound, and it’s great be reminded of that in day-to-day living.<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'E.L.K.

Rollin'' With the Flow', '<!--QuoteEBegin-->Four years after releasing their Merge debut, Frozen Letter, Spider Bags have returned with Someday Everything Will Be Fine, an LP that ascends to new levels of aural punch and perspective. The years that elapsed between records were crucial in enabling that progress to take place. “We had gone as far as we could go with touring all the time, and cranking out singles and our own records,” says frontman Dan McGee, reflecting on the prolific touring and recording pace he and his bandmates have kept up since 2007. “I really wanted to see what would happen if we were just concentrating on material instead of preparing for shows. We were really able to focus on maybe 12, 14 songs—knowing we were going to have to bring them down to 10—and I think it’s a better record for it. We rehearsed ‘My Heart Is a Flame in Reverse’ and ‘Reckless’ for a year before we recorded them. That’s not something we’ve ever had the time to do before.” Recorded in Memphis at Bunker Audio by Andrew McCalla (who also engineered Spider Bags’ seminal 2012 rock and roll party record Shake my Head), Someday Everything Will Be Fine leverages the limitations and glory of the Tascam 388, a vintage recording/mixing device that’s acquired a mythos via its association with legendary records by Dinosaur Jr., East River Pipe, the Black Keys, Ty Segall, and Thee Oh Sees to name a few. The Tascam’s charms are more immediate, with a visceral resonance all its own. “It’s an 8-track machine designed for smaller studios, so your eight tracks are on quarter-inch tape. It squashes the tracks so close together they bleed into each other, which, you know, shouldn’t work, but it does. There’s also a certain compression that happens on those machines that cannot be duplicated. It feels live, but it also sounds like it took place in a studio. It’s not about being an analog purist—it’s about finding the medium that works best for what you’re trying to create, and the band has never sounded better than we sound on this record. I wanted to do as much as we could live, the four of us together playing the guitar solos and tripping effects on the fly like we would at a show. I wanted to capture the performance without the use of infinite tracks and the ability to click away mistakes. You have to be well rehearsed to make a record that way. The album is almost entirely first takes. ‘Burning Sand’ is not only a first take but also the first time we played the song all the way through, with a minute-long instrumental opening that was completely off the cuff. That’s how my favorite rock and roll records were made. It’s the limitations, I think, that create the performance.” Recording in Memphis also lent its own mojo to the album’s sound and feel. According to McGee, “Rock and roll just sounds better there. I swear.” Adding to this sound is the featured playing of Memphis giants Jack Oblivian, John Whittemore, Jana Misener and Krista Wroten-Combest of the Memphis Dawls, and multi-instrumentalist Seth Moody. “It’s a great town with so much individuality and history, musical and otherwise, that can’t help but seep into the music you’re making. I love that city.” Other non-Spider Bag contributing musicians include Patrick Stickles of Titus Andronicus and Matthew Hoopengardner of Austin, Texas, rock and roll legends the Golden Boys. The LP opens with “Reckless,” a strangely organic-sounding sprawl wrought from different parts of songs that McGee had struggled to complete, which peaks with gorgeous guitar fireworks. “The song didn’t seem satisfied until I brought in a couple pieces from other songs I hadn’t finished,” says McGee. “Steve [Oliva, the band’s bassist] said when we finished recording it, ‘There’s seven parts in that song and none of them repeat.’” From that epic build-up, the record returns to earth with the sprightly “Oxcart Blues,” whose twinned guitars a...<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Merge Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-48kHz FLAC (tracks)', '38:27', '105 / 239 / 449 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/j9srnvv9hwu5/Someday_Everything_Will_Be_Fine_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-10 20:21:10.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-10 17:21:10', '2018-08-10 17:21:10'),

To me, that roughly means "the stuff from which stuff generates." It''s a short hand way of evoking all the elements that I''m mashing up in this music. The idea is basically that it''s this collision of genres, and collision of different versions of "American music." It''s also an album that doesn''t fit very neatly into a category of album — studio? live? remix? Maybe all, or none, of the above. This is a new mutant variety of Elephant Micah, better suited to survive the cultural climate of the moment in so-called "Trump''s America." It lives! I guess the lodestone in the process of making this was the kind of global avant garde mood that''s prevalent in a lot of 1980s albums I admire. Things like Joni Mitchell''s Dog Eat Dog and Arthur Russell''s Calling Out of Context. These records where singers were making really eclectic and outward looking productions — writing *through* the process of recording, and literally *play- ing* with technologies that were totally new to them. All the gear that I gathered to make the album was basically discarded or devalued. I got a bunch of stuff from Craigslist that interested me: a cheap FM synth, some Hindustani electronics, and an old three-head tape deck to use as a "poor man''s space echo." The icing on the cake is a one-of-a-kind home- made digital synthesizer called "The Mutant". I worked with my brother to design it. He built it and coded it. The concept of the synth is parallel to the concept of the album itself. It''s an electronic take on "folk" sounds (bends, drones, modal playing) and folk creative approaches (a cobbling together and reformatting of existing elements).<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Western Vinyl', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks)', '32:07', '74.6 / 136 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/n1k81xrhxhpn/Elephant_Micah_-_Genericana_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-10 20:21:15.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-10 17:21:15', '2018-08-10 17:21:15'),

Wilkes, Al Perkins and members of the Time Jumpers, ''America''s Child'' bursts with Copeland''s bravado and embraces with her tenderness.<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Alligator', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks)', '48:56', '113 / 302 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/7iod8jhnhim8/Americas_Child_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-11 20:15:17.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-11 17:15:17', '2018-08-11 17:15:17');

Schubert began this composition in August 1824, or possibly even as late as March 1825. Most of the work on it took place in the summer of 1825, during the longest journey of his life. It took him from Vienna via Linz, Steyr, Gmunden (where he found the scenery "truly heavenly"), Salzburg and then up to Bad Gastein, where he saw some magnificent alpine peaks. The first page of the score manuscript is dated "March 1828" – possibly the month in which he finally completed the work. On November 19 of that same year, Schubert died at the age of only thirty-one. The symphony was premiered posthumously on March 21, 1839 in the Leipzig Gewandhaus, and conducted by the Gewandhaus Kapellmeister at that time - the 30-year-old Felix Mendelssohn. This is a star-studded and outstanding interpretation of one of the most important compositions of the Romantic symphonic repertoire. <br><br>Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks<br>Mariss Jansons, conductor <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'BR-Klassik', NULL, 'FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks+booklet)', '60:18', '271 / 565 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/h1x9vshm0m2e/Schubert_Symphony_No_9_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-11 20:15:25.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-11 17:15:25', '2018-08-11 17:15:25'),

Possibly it was the high regard in which he held the genre that for so long stopped him from actually completing a quartet of his own – although he had first seriously considered writing one in 1828, it took almost 15 years before he was ready to fully commit to the idea. Once he had done so, there was no returning: during some hectic summer weeks in 1842, a year which is often called ‘Schumann''s chamber music year’, he completed the three string quartets of his Op. 41, presenting them to his wife Clara on her 23rd birthday in September. In her diary she wrote ‘… they delighted me to the utmost. Everything in them is new, clear, expertly worked out and always idiomatic.’ <br><br>The Op.41 quartets were to be the only ones from Schumann''s pen, but this is not to suggest that he was dissatisfied with them: in 1847 he wrote to his publisher that he regarded the quartets ‘as my best work from earlier times’. They are here performed by the Norwegian Engegård Quartet, whose latest release on BIS, of quartets by Grieg and Sibelius, has received critical acclaim, for instance in Gramophone: ‘Those seeking the Grieg/Sibelius pairing in modern sound would be hard pressed to find better.’ <br><br>Schumann gave the three quartets to Clara for her 23rd birthday on 13th September 1842. In the couple’s shared diary she noted: ‘The gift of his three quartets – which he arranged to be performed for me... that very evening... – brought me the greatest joy. About the quartets, all I can say is that they delighted me to the utmost. Everything in them is new, clear, expertly worked out and always idiomatic.’ The fact that Schumann wrote no more string quartets does not indicate that he was dissatisfied with them: in 1847 he wrote to his publisher Härtel that he still regarded the quartets ‘as my best work from earlier times’. And posterity has unanimously shared the view of the eminent Viennese critic Eduard Hanslick that the three Op. 41 quartets ‘are among the all-time jewels of chamber music’.

Speaking of the track choices, she says “Musically it’s a mix of folky songs and classic tunes.” She is bilingual and switches naturally between Welsh and English – both on the album and at home. “I’ve always sung in Welsh and it’s something that comes naturally,” she says of her passion for the language. “It’s my generation’s responsibility now to bring it forward to the next generation.”<br><br>Charming and modest, Elan (a classic Welsh name pronounced ‘Elle-Ann’) has been competing since the age of four in the traditional Eisteddfod singing contests – a major festival series in Wales, celebrating music and culture and reaching over 150,000 people each year. Last year, Elan was a finalist her Eisteddfod category, which is where she was spotted by Decca executives and later offered a recording contract. Elan’s pure and authentic voice soars so effortlessly that, even in a country renowned for its singing, she is a standout.

He’s wildly poetic, especially when recounting his dedication to music, and the work that led to this particular collection of delicately passionate songs. “These things became the vehicle by which we traveled, giving us reason to spend most of our lives in a van of uncertainty.” <br><br>Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread is the follow up to 2016’s Mowing — the first record he released under his own name, after fronting psych folk projects Page France and Cotton Jones — June 2017’s Some Twist, and its extension, The Load EP. The sprawling new album was recorded in Benny Yurco’s one-bedroom apartment in downtown Burlington, Vermont. Nau and his collaborators had a cool little set up going in Yurco’s spot — drums and bass took over the bedroom, the guitar amp in the bathroom, Nau’s vocals and piano in the living room, and a vibraphone in the kitchen. It’s the first time one of Nau’s records happened all in one place, and it feels most like a band record than ever before, he says; Nau and this particular group of musicians held it down together as a true team, which is why Nau named the record in their honor. Nothing more was added to it than what was recorded by Nau and the band in Yurco’s apartment. It didn’t feel like the right thing to do to mess with it post-facto, he adds. “It’s a documented live performance. It happened the way it happened, and that’s how it is.” <br><br>You can hear that organicness all across Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread, from the golden-sounding, glibly existential love song “Less Than Positive,” one of the oldest written on album, to the smoky and melancholic “Smudge,” one of the most recent compositions. “It wasn’t until recently that I ever considered revisiting songs from so long ago,” Nau says of playing songs he wrote ages ago, like “Less Than Positive.” “But something happened where I’m now able to appreciate the distance between those songs written long ago, and where I’m at now. It feels like playing someone else’s song.” Nau stresses this theme of time and distance in talking about the record. And those metaphysical thoughts permeate the music, which hangs in an ageless space, somehow classic-sounding and fresh like a cold wind, at the same time. <br><br>The songs on this layered record sound sunny and familiar, like sharing stories and worries with a close friend on a late summer day. In a gorgeous and natural way, he contemplates his own process, those feelings of uncertainty. “Making it too hard just comes easier,” Nau croons on “Funny In Real Life,” an exquisite meditation on creation and self. “Truth is such a beautiful force/And every time we find the chorus/There’s no second-guessing the real/I don’t ever know how I feel.” <br><br>Nau shines when he’s nestled in that medium between melancholy and carefree. He seems to be thinking about the past, present, and future, all at the same time, and his songs move between pain and joy, fires and rivers, faraway stars, icy Saturdays, clouds of smoke, between shelter and flowers in the rain. “And it just keeps going, if it’s done it’s done/Still flow in the flowing, all around the sun,” he sings on “Smudge,” the record’s finale, which is about love, and memories, and loneliness, and apprehension — “Something coming around some bend/Waiting for something to never end” — all at once. It’s all just part of the waves of life; sometimes you get stuck, or things move slower, and sometimes the pace steps up. And that seems to be the gist of Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread — that there are “different movements” in the self, that constantly figuring yourself out is all part of the journey. “As long as love is the motion,” Nau says, “it might get there.” Wherever there is. <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Full Time Hobby', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks)', '40:44', '95.8 / 238 / 436 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/plcnv59i4uzg/Michael_Nau_and_the_Mighty_Thread_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-11 20:18:15.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-11 17:18:15', '2018-08-11 17:18:15'),

Guitarist and lead vocalist Jeremy Stephens, fiddle player Corrina Rose Logston Stephens, and banjo player Kurt Stephenson assembled a list of decades-old songs that they could flawlessly recreate on stage, including some gems from the Stanley Brothers.

Comprised of brothers Collin and Kyle Rausch and best friends Konnor Ervin, Kyle Little and Ross Brown, Shy Boys are the heartland’s answer to The Beach Boys had Alex Chilton been on guitar. <br><br>But if a harmony falls into a microphone in the middle of America does anyone really hear it? Some do. Take for instance Shy Boys’ 2014 self-titled debut on local Kansas City label, High Dive Records - I first came across this album while living in Los Angeles and catching wind of a band from my home town that I was told could "actually sing," and after the first spin, through the muddy fidelity, man, could they actually sing. <br><br>Shy Boys’ history isn''t too dissimilar from any other Midwestern band. Like the many Replacements or Husker Düs before them - they exist neither here nor there, but instead, somewhere anonymously in the middle. And though you may not find the same opportunity floating in the middle as one would Here or There, you are allotted a certain amount of time and space to grow both yourself and your craft into what you want it to be. Over the past four years, that is exactly what Shy Boys have done and that is what brings us here today. <br><br>On August 3, 2018, the world will see the release of their second record, Bell House, out on legendary and globally cherished record label Polyvinyl, bringing both their profile and music to the surface for the first time. <br><br>The album’s title is taken from the band’s beloved headquarters - the old house on Bell Street in Kansas City where they lived together for the better part of 5 years. <br><br>“‘Lived’ is a loose term,” says lead songwriter Collin. “It was more like a bum den than anything else. There was a giant hole in the floor of the kitchen that had a piece of plywood over it. In the backyard, weeds got like 6 feet high in the summer. It was its own thriving biome. We lived in trash.” <br><br>Musically, Collin describes the songs on Bell House taking shape through “a group of guys trying to get through some sort of mutual identity crisis. The lifestyle became overwhelming and really seeped into the music.” <br><br>In the time since the release of ST, Collin saw himself falling in love and getting married, leaving the old house on Bell Street, and moving back into his mom’s house with his wife in a suburb of the city. It''s here where the songs of Bell House were born. Being back under the same roof he had grown up in where there was “still writing on the walls from childhood," Rausch found himself reflective and looking out at his life as a whole. <br><br>Take closing track “Champion” for instance, a song Collin says is dedicated to his and Kyle’s mother. “It’s just a note saying that she took care of us when we were young, and now it’s time for us to be there and take care of her.” <br><br>The reflective spirit sprinkled throughout the album is also evident on lead single, “Take The Doggie,” a bouncy, guitar driven track centered around wanting to secretly rescue their neighbor’s dog from an abusive owner, or on album highlight “Evil Sin,” which tackles the memory of drummer/bassist Konnor Ervin getting robbed. <br><br>But through all of this, Rausch kept his passion in his band, if even for nothing more than to - in his own words - have an excuse to keep hanging out with his brother and best friends. <br><br>“I have to keep Shy Boys alive to have a regular excuse to hang out with them,” says Collin. “To keep the band alive, I have to write songs. To be able to travel with my buddies, there has to be a new record.” <br><br>There is an old term that''s kicked around in country music called a "blood harmony" - in which two people in the same blood line, usually siblings, harmonize with one another in real time. Perhaps that is Shy Boys’ magic touch, putting them just a notch above all the other angels out there in the indie rock choir, and it makes sense, though no longer practicing evangelicals, Collin and Kyle grew up singing besides their parents in their church choir, so their keen sense of harmony is nothing new to them, but instead a life practice devoted to the voice as an instrument. <br><br>The result is Bell House, and the result is beautiful. There is something sensitive to the touch about this album, which is perhaps another way of saying that, well - Shy Boys are indeed Shy Boys. I envision the band as a solid unit, with each moving part as an equal. There is a heavy sense of family in everything they do both, literally and figuratively. Bruce Springsteen''s 1980 song “Highway Patrolman” always seems to come to mind; <br><br>"Yeah me and Franky out laughing and drinking, <br>Nothing feels better than blood on blood." <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Polyvinyl Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks)', '22:23', '53.7 / 136 / 247 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/3nyji7ju6uir/Shy_Boys_-_Bell_House_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-11 20:19:49.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-11 17:19:49', '2018-08-11 17:19:49');

Includes 2 previously unissued bonus tracks.  New liner notes from Nighthawk co-founder Leroy Jodie Pierson.  Previously unseen photos and ephemera. Ronnie Davis was born in Savannah La Mar in Jamaica''s Westmorland Parish in July of 1950. He began his professional career as a musician in 1967 when he was recruited to join The Tennors, a vocal group who had already scored a big hit with "Pressure And The Slide" on Coxsone''s Studio One label. The group scored another massive hit in 1968 with "Ride Your Donkey" with more hits following in 1973 when Ronnie led the group on "Weather Report" for Duke Reid''s Treasure Isle label and "Take Heed" for Bunny Lee. Both records sold well, and with encouragement from Bunny Lee, Ronnie left the group to pursue a solo career. During the mid-''70s Ronnie was among the most prolific of Jamaica''s vocalists, recording over 100 titles for a variety of labels and producers including a large body of work for Bunny Lee. By the late ''70s Davis was producing his own work for release on his own On Top label while continuing to work for other producers. He bonded with producer Lloyd Campbell who released some of Davis'' best work on the Spider Man label and included "Won''t You Come Home" which became a minor hit due in part to the superb rhythm track from The Revolutionaires. Ronnie loved this record, and soon returned to Lloyd Campbell with Keith Porter, a friend from Savannah La Mar who had written a new song for the rhythm. Together they cut "In A Dis A Time" with Keith leading the fierce Rastafarian classic with sweet harmony from Ronnie. The song, credited to The Itals, became a massive local hit. They added a third singer, Lloyd Ricketts, and Campbell and continued recording. In late 1979, Robert Schoenfeld and Leroy Jodie Pierson of Nighthawk Records began searching for The Itals and after tracking them down, they found themselves gathered at Aquarius Studio listening to superb Spider Man tracks by the group. A few days later, Keith Porter, Lloyd Ricketts and Ronnie Davis auditioned songs for their very first album, Brutal Out Deh. The group was signed to a five-year contract and began work on their album. Robert Palmer wrote a rave review published in the weekend edition of the New York Times, and sales exploded. The Itals became one of the most successful touring reggae acts in the U.S. Their third album, Rasta Philosophy was among the five final nominations for the 1987 Best Reggae Album Grammy® award. In the 1980''s when the group splintered, Ronnie felt that he should create his own vocal group. He had never stopped recording as a solo artist and with the aid of long-established Savannah La Mar vocalists Lloyd Ricketts, Roy Smith and Robert Doctor, he recorded a new album Come Straight, released in 1996 credited to Ronnie Davis and Idren. Now remastered with two bonus tracks, new liner notes from Nighthawk''s Leroy Jodie Pierson and previously unseen photos, this acclaimed album has never sounded better!<!--QuoteEnd--></div><!--QuoteEEnd-->  <br /><br /><br/><div style="text-align:center;"><!--QuoteBegin--><div class="quote"><!--QuoteEBegin-->Download Link Isra.Cloud&gt;&gt;&gt;<b><!--sizestart:4--><span style="font-size:14pt;"><!--/sizestart--><br><a href="https://isra.cloud/vxve1ejagr7r/Ronnie_Davis_And_Idren_-_Come_Straight_FLAC.rar.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external noreferrer">Ronnie_Davis_And_Idren_-_Come_Straight_FLAC.rar - 353.8 MB</a><br><a href="https://isra.cloud/a81nr8qy378l/Ronnie_Davis_And_Idren_-_Come_Straight_MP3.rar.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external noreferrer">Ronnie_Davis_And_Idren_-_Come_Straight_MP3.rar - 153.0 MB</a><br><!--sizeend--></span><!--/sizeend--></b></div><!--QuoteEnd--></div><!--QuoteEEnd-->  ', '<!--QuoteEBegin-->Remastered roots reggae classic.

He began his professional career as a musician in 1967 when he was recruited to join The Tennors, a vocal group who had already scored a big hit with "Pressure And The Slide" on Coxsone''s Studio One label. The group scored another massive hit in 1968 with "Ride Your Donkey" with more hits following in 1973 when Ronnie led the group on "Weather Report" for Duke Reid''s Treasure Isle label and "Take Heed" for Bunny Lee. Both records sold well, and with encouragement from Bunny Lee, Ronnie left the group to pursue a solo career. During the mid-''70s Ronnie was among the most prolific of Jamaica''s vocalists, recording over 100 titles for a variety of labels and producers including a large body of work for Bunny Lee. By the late ''70s Davis was producing his own work for release on his own On Top label while continuing to work for other producers. He bonded with producer Lloyd Campbell who released some of Davis'' best work on the Spider Man label and included "Won''t You Come Home" which became a minor hit due in part to the superb rhythm track from The Revolutionaires. Ronnie loved this record, and soon returned to Lloyd Campbell with Keith Porter, a friend from Savannah La Mar who had written a new song for the rhythm. Together they cut "In A Dis A Time" with Keith leading the fierce Rastafarian classic with sweet harmony from Ronnie. The song, credited to The Itals, became a massive local hit. They added a third singer, Lloyd Ricketts, and Campbell and continued recording. In late 1979, Robert Schoenfeld and Leroy Jodie Pierson of Nighthawk Records began searching for The Itals and after tracking them down, they found themselves gathered at Aquarius Studio listening to superb Spider Man tracks by the group. A few days later, Keith Porter, Lloyd Ricketts and Ronnie Davis auditioned songs for their very first album, Brutal Out Deh. The group was signed to a five-year contract and began work on their album. Robert Palmer wrote a rave review published in the weekend edition of the New York Times, and sales exploded. The Itals became one of the most successful touring reggae acts in the U.S. Their third album, Rasta Philosophy was among the five final nominations for the 1987 Best Reggae Album Grammy® award. In the 1980''s when the group splintered, Ronnie felt that he should create his own vocal group. He had never stopped recording as a solo artist and with the aid of long-established Savannah La Mar vocalists Lloyd Ricketts, Roy Smith and Robert Doctor, he recorded a new album Come Straight, released in 1996 credited to Ronnie Davis and Idren. Now remastered with two bonus tracks, new liner notes from Nighthawk''s Leroy Jodie Pierson and previously unseen photos, this acclaimed album has never sounded better!<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Omnivore Recordings', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks)', '63:44', '153 / 353 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/vxve1ejagr7r/Ronnie_Davis_And_Idren_-_Come_Straight_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-11 20:20:04.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-11 17:20:04', '2018-08-11 17:20:04'),

Gulp are on a journey, a state of perpetual transition. The band make mini Kraut-pop epics, informed equally by the sun flares of the Californian desert and the drizzle of pure, sweet Scottish rain and northern light. Debut album ‘Season Sun’ was a home-grown delight, a ramshackle, endlessly inventive selection of dreamy psychedelic nuggets to watch the world flash past.<br><br>New album ‘All Good Wishes’ half-inches its title from a vintage Scottish postcard, and it’s emblematic of the changes the pair have undergone. “I think all through making this record we were looking at relocating,” Guto explains. “Whereas the first record was more of a road trip this is possibly a bit more focussed on home, and focussed on where we’re from and where we’re looking to go to. It’s partly a farewell to Wales, and hello to Scotland.”<br><br>The record was largely built in South Wales, a three-year process that saw the band retreat to their basement for endless sonic incisions and revisions. A broader, wider, perhaps bolder experience than their debut, ‘All Good Wishes’ is rooted in fantastic pop songwriting, in creating three minute vignettes that express complex ideas in a simple, accessible, endlessly fascinating way. Endlessly restrained yet infinitely open, each Gulp track is like a world in miniature, ideas borrowed from Krautrock and electronic culture slimmed down into these infinitely enjoyable pop songs.<br><br>Minimalist Kraut-pop with a dreamy, Cocteau Twins esque vibe, recent single ‘Morning Velvet Sky’ was a potent introduction to the duo’s ever-shifting realm.

Rollin'' With the Flow', '<!--QuoteEBegin-->Four years after releasing their Merge debut, Frozen Letter, Spider Bags have returned with Someday Everything Will Be Fine, an LP that ascends to new levels of aural punch and perspective. The years that elapsed between records were crucial in enabling that progress to take place. “We had gone as far as we could go with touring all the time, and cranking out singles and our own records,” says frontman Dan McGee, reflecting on the prolific touring and recording pace he and his bandmates have kept up since 2007. “I really wanted to see what would happen if we were just concentrating on material instead of preparing for shows. We were really able to focus on maybe 12, 14 songs—knowing we were going to have to bring them down to 10—and I think it’s a better record for it. We rehearsed ‘My Heart Is a Flame in Reverse’ and ‘Reckless’ for a year before we recorded them. That’s not something we’ve ever had the time to do before.” Recorded in Memphis at Bunker Audio by Andrew McCalla (who also engineered Spider Bags’ seminal 2012 rock and roll party record Shake my Head), Someday Everything Will Be Fine leverages the limitations and glory of the Tascam 388, a vintage recording/mixing device that’s acquired a mythos via its association with legendary records by Dinosaur Jr., East River Pipe, the Black Keys, Ty Segall, and Thee Oh Sees to name a few. The Tascam’s charms are more immediate, with a visceral resonance all its own. “It’s an 8-track machine designed for smaller studios, so your eight tracks are on quarter-inch tape. It squashes the tracks so close together they bleed into each other, which, you know, shouldn’t work, but it does. There’s also a certain compression that happens on those machines that cannot be duplicated. It feels live, but it also sounds like it took place in a studio. It’s not about being an analog purist—it’s about finding the medium that works best for what you’re trying to create, and the band has never sounded better than we sound on this record. I wanted to do as much as we could live, the four of us together playing the guitar solos and tripping effects on the fly like we would at a show. I wanted to capture the performance without the use of infinite tracks and the ability to click away mistakes. You have to be well rehearsed to make a record that way. The album is almost entirely first takes. ‘Burning Sand’ is not only a first take but also the first time we played the song all the way through, with a minute-long instrumental opening that was completely off the cuff. That’s how my favorite rock and roll records were made. It’s the limitations, I think, that create the performance.” Recording in Memphis also lent its own mojo to the album’s sound and feel. According to McGee, “Rock and roll just sounds better there. I swear.” Adding to this sound is the featured playing of Memphis giants Jack Oblivian, John Whittemore, Jana Misener and Krista Wroten-Combest of the Memphis Dawls, and multi-instrumentalist Seth Moody. “It’s a great town with so much individuality and history, musical and otherwise, that can’t help but seep into the music you’re making. I love that city.” Other non-Spider Bag contributing musicians include Patrick Stickles of Titus Andronicus and Matthew Hoopengardner of Austin, Texas, rock and roll legends the Golden Boys. The LP opens with “Reckless,” a strangely organic-sounding sprawl wrought from different parts of songs that McGee had struggled to complete, which peaks with gorgeous guitar fireworks. “The song didn’t seem satisfied until I brought in a couple pieces from other songs I hadn’t finished,” says McGee. “Steve [Oliva, the band’s bassist] said when we finished recording it, ‘There’s seven parts in that song and none of them repeat.’” From that epic build-up, the record returns to earth with the sprightly “Oxcart Blues,” whose twinned guitars a...<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Merge Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-48kHz FLAC (tracks)', '38:27', '105 / 239 / 449 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/j9srnvv9hwu5/Someday_Everything_Will_Be_Fine_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-11 20:21:13.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-11 17:21:14', '2018-08-11 17:21:14'),

To me, that roughly means "the stuff from which stuff generates." It''s a short hand way of evoking all the elements that I''m mashing up in this music. The idea is basically that it''s this collision of genres, and collision of different versions of "American music." It''s also an album that doesn''t fit very neatly into a category of album — studio? live? remix? Maybe all, or none, of the above. This is a new mutant variety of Elephant Micah, better suited to survive the cultural climate of the moment in so-called "Trump''s America." It lives! I guess the lodestone in the process of making this was the kind of global avant garde mood that''s prevalent in a lot of 1980s albums I admire. Things like Joni Mitchell''s Dog Eat Dog and Arthur Russell''s Calling Out of Context. These records where singers were making really eclectic and outward looking productions — writing *through* the process of recording, and literally *play- ing* with technologies that were totally new to them. All the gear that I gathered to make the album was basically discarded or devalued. I got a bunch of stuff from Craigslist that interested me: a cheap FM synth, some Hindustani electronics, and an old three-head tape deck to use as a "poor man''s space echo." The icing on the cake is a one-of-a-kind home- made digital synthesizer called "The Mutant". I worked with my brother to design it. He built it and coded it. The concept of the synth is parallel to the concept of the album itself. It''s an electronic take on "folk" sounds (bends, drones, modal playing) and folk creative approaches (a cobbling together and reformatting of existing elements).<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Western Vinyl', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks)', '32:07', '74.6 / 136 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/n1k81xrhxhpn/Elephant_Micah_-_Genericana_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-11 20:21:19.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-11 17:21:19', '2018-08-11 17:21:19'),

Schubert began this composition in August 1824, or possibly even as late as March 1825. Most of the work on it took place in the summer of 1825, during the longest journey of his life. It took him from Vienna via Linz, Steyr, Gmunden (where he found the scenery "truly heavenly"), Salzburg and then up to Bad Gastein, where he saw some magnificent alpine peaks. The first page of the score manuscript is dated "March 1828" – possibly the month in which he finally completed the work. On November 19 of that same year, Schubert died at the age of only thirty-one. The symphony was premiered posthumously on March 21, 1839 in the Leipzig Gewandhaus, and conducted by the Gewandhaus Kapellmeister at that time - the 30-year-old Felix Mendelssohn.

Possibly it was the high regard in which he held the genre that for so long stopped him from actually completing a quartet of his own – although he had first seriously considered writing one in 1828, it took almost 15 years before he was ready to fully commit to the idea. Once he had done so, there was no returning: during some hectic summer weeks in 1842, a year which is often called ‘Schumann''s chamber music year’, he completed the three string quartets of his Op. 41, presenting them to his wife Clara on her 23rd birthday in September. In her diary she wrote ‘… they delighted me to the utmost. Everything in them is new, clear, expertly worked out and always idiomatic.’ <br><br>The Op.41 quartets were to be the only ones from Schumann''s pen, but this is not to suggest that he was dissatisfied with them: in 1847 he wrote to his publisher that he regarded the quartets ‘as my best work from earlier times’. They are here performed by the Norwegian Engegård Quartet, whose latest release on BIS, of quartets by Grieg and Sibelius, has received critical acclaim, for instance in Gramophone: ‘Those seeking the Grieg/Sibelius pairing in modern sound would be hard pressed to find better.’ <br><br>Schumann gave the three quartets to Clara for her 23rd birthday on 13th September 1842. In the couple’s shared diary she noted: ‘The gift of his three quartets – which he arranged to be performed for me... that very evening... – brought me the greatest joy. About the quartets, all I can say is that they delighted me to the utmost. Everything in them is new, clear, expertly worked out and always idiomatic.’ The fact that Schumann wrote no more string quartets does not indicate that he was dissatisfied with them: in 1847 he wrote to his publisher Härtel that he still regarded the quartets ‘as my best work from earlier times’. And posterity has unanimously shared the view of the eminent Viennese critic Eduard Hanslick that the three Op. 41 quartets ‘are among the all-time jewels of chamber music’.

He’s wildly poetic, especially when recounting his dedication to music, and the work that led to this particular collection of delicately passionate songs. “These things became the vehicle by which we traveled, giving us reason to spend most of our lives in a van of uncertainty.” <br><br>Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread is the follow up to 2016’s Mowing — the first record he released under his own name, after fronting psych folk projects Page France and Cotton Jones — June 2017’s Some Twist, and its extension, The Load EP. The sprawling new album was recorded in Benny Yurco’s one-bedroom apartment in downtown Burlington, Vermont. Nau and his collaborators had a cool little set up going in Yurco’s spot — drums and bass took over the bedroom, the guitar amp in the bathroom, Nau’s vocals and piano in the living room, and a vibraphone in the kitchen. It’s the first time one of Nau’s records happened all in one place, and it feels most like a band record than ever before, he says; Nau and this particular group of musicians held it down together as a true team, which is why Nau named the record in their honor. Nothing more was added to it than what was recorded by Nau and the band in Yurco’s apartment. It didn’t feel like the right thing to do to mess with it post-facto, he adds. “It’s a documented live performance. It happened the way it happened, and that’s how it is.” <br><br>You can hear that organicness all across Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread, from the golden-sounding, glibly existential love song “Less Than Positive,” one of the oldest written on album, to the smoky and melancholic “Smudge,” one of the most recent compositions. “It wasn’t until recently that I ever considered revisiting songs from so long ago,” Nau says of playing songs he wrote ages ago, like “Less Than Positive.” “But something happened where I’m now able to appreciate the distance between those songs written long ago, and where I’m at now. It feels like playing someone else’s song.” Nau stresses this theme of time and distance in talking about the record. And those metaphysical thoughts permeate the music, which hangs in an ageless space, somehow classic-sounding and fresh like a cold wind, at the same time. <br><br>The songs on this layered record sound sunny and familiar, like sharing stories and worries with a close friend on a late summer day. In a gorgeous and natural way, he contemplates his own process, those feelings of uncertainty. “Making it too hard just comes easier,” Nau croons on “Funny In Real Life,” an exquisite meditation on creation and self. “Truth is such a beautiful force/And every time we find the chorus/There’s no second-guessing the real/I don’t ever know how I feel.” <br><br>Nau shines when he’s nestled in that medium between melancholy and carefree. He seems to be thinking about the past, present, and future, all at the same time, and his songs move between pain and joy, fires and rivers, faraway stars, icy Saturdays, clouds of smoke, between shelter and flowers in the rain. “And it just keeps going, if it’s done it’s done/Still flow in the flowing, all around the sun,” he sings on “Smudge,” the record’s finale, which is about love, and memories, and loneliness, and apprehension — “Something coming around some bend/Waiting for something to never end” — all at once. It’s all just part of the waves of life; sometimes you get stuck, or things move slower, and sometimes the pace steps up. And that seems to be the gist of Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread — that there are “different movements” in the self, that constantly figuring yourself out is all part of the journey. “As long as love is the motion,” Nau says, “it might get there.” Wherever there is. <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Full Time Hobby', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks)', '40:44', '95.8 / 238 / 436 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/plcnv59i4uzg/Michael_Nau_and_the_Mighty_Thread_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-12 20:18:14.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-12 17:18:14', '2018-08-12 17:18:14'),

His ability to flourish in so many different genres is a testament to his lifelong dedication to his songwriting craft. Plus, he is one helluva singer.

Comprised of brothers Collin and Kyle Rausch and best friends Konnor Ervin, Kyle Little and Ross Brown, Shy Boys are the heartland’s answer to The Beach Boys had Alex Chilton been on guitar. <br><br>But if a harmony falls into a microphone in the middle of America does anyone really hear it? Some do. Take for instance Shy Boys’ 2014 self-titled debut on local Kansas City label, High Dive Records - I first came across this album while living in Los Angeles and catching wind of a band from my home town that I was told could "actually sing," and after the first spin, through the muddy fidelity, man, could they actually sing. <br><br>Shy Boys’ history isn''t too dissimilar from any other Midwestern band. Like the many Replacements or Husker Düs before them - they exist neither here nor there, but instead, somewhere anonymously in the middle. And though you may not find the same opportunity floating in the middle as one would Here or There, you are allotted a certain amount of time and space to grow both yourself and your craft into what you want it to be. Over the past four years, that is exactly what Shy Boys have done and that is what brings us here today. <br><br>On August 3, 2018, the world will see the release of their second record, Bell House, out on legendary and globally cherished record label Polyvinyl, bringing both their profile and music to the surface for the first time. <br><br>The album’s title is taken from the band’s beloved headquarters - the old house on Bell Street in Kansas City where they lived together for the better part of 5 years. <br><br>“‘Lived’ is a loose term,” says lead songwriter Collin. “It was more like a bum den than anything else. There was a giant hole in the floor of the kitchen that had a piece of plywood over it. In the backyard, weeds got like 6 feet high in the summer. It was its own thriving biome. We lived in trash.” <br><br>Musically, Collin describes the songs on Bell House taking shape through “a group of guys trying to get through some sort of mutual identity crisis. The lifestyle became overwhelming and really seeped into the music.” <br><br>In the time since the release of ST, Collin saw himself falling in love and getting married, leaving the old house on Bell Street, and moving back into his mom’s house with his wife in a suburb of the city. It''s here where the songs of Bell House were born. Being back under the same roof he had grown up in where there was “still writing on the walls from childhood," Rausch found himself reflective and looking out at his life as a whole. <br><br>Take closing track “Champion” for instance, a song Collin says is dedicated to his and Kyle’s mother. “It’s just a note saying that she took care of us when we were young, and now it’s time for us to be there and take care of her.” <br><br>The reflective spirit sprinkled throughout the album is also evident on lead single, “Take The Doggie,” a bouncy, guitar driven track centered around wanting to secretly rescue their neighbor’s dog from an abusive owner, or on album highlight “Evil Sin,” which tackles the memory of drummer/bassist Konnor Ervin getting robbed. <br><br>But through all of this, Rausch kept his passion in his band, if even for nothing more than to - in his own words - have an excuse to keep hanging out with his brother and best friends. <br><br>“I have to keep Shy Boys alive to have a regular excuse to hang out with them,” says Collin. “To keep the band alive, I have to write songs. To be able to travel with my buddies, there has to be a new record.” <br><br>There is an old term that''s kicked around in country music called a "blood harmony" - in which two people in the same blood line, usually siblings, harmonize with one another in real time. Perhaps that is Shy Boys’ magic touch, putting them just a notch above all the other angels out there in the indie rock choir, and it makes sense, though no longer practicing evangelicals, Collin and Kyle grew up singing besides their parents in their church choir, so their keen sense of harmony is nothing new to them, but instead a life practice devoted to the voice as an instrument. <br><br>The result is Bell House, and the result is beautiful. There is something sensitive to the touch about this album, which is perhaps another way of saying that, well - Shy Boys are indeed Shy Boys. I envision the band as a solid unit, with each moving part as an equal. There is a heavy sense of family in everything they do both, literally and figuratively. Bruce Springsteen''s 1980 song “Highway Patrolman” always seems to come to mind; <br><br>"Yeah me and Franky out laughing and drinking, <br>Nothing feels better than blood on blood." <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Polyvinyl Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks)', '22:23', '53.7 / 136 / 247 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/3nyji7ju6uir/Shy_Boys_-_Bell_House_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-12 20:19:49.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-12 17:19:49', '2018-08-12 17:19:49'),

The band make mini Kraut-pop epics, informed equally by the sun flares of the Californian desert and the drizzle of pure, sweet Scottish rain and northern light. Debut album ‘Season Sun’ was a home-grown delight, a ramshackle, endlessly inventive selection of dreamy psychedelic nuggets to watch the world flash past.<br><br>New album ‘All Good Wishes’ half-inches its title from a vintage Scottish postcard, and it’s emblematic of the changes the pair have undergone. “I think all through making this record we were looking at relocating,” Guto explains. “Whereas the first record was more of a road trip this is possibly a bit more focussed on home, and focussed on where we’re from and where we’re looking to go to. It’s partly a farewell to Wales, and hello to Scotland.”<br><br>The record was largely built in South Wales, a three-year process that saw the band retreat to their basement for endless sonic incisions and revisions. A broader, wider, perhaps bolder experience than their debut, ‘All Good Wishes’ is rooted in fantastic pop songwriting, in creating three minute vignettes that express complex ideas in a simple, accessible, endlessly fascinating way.

The years that elapsed between records were crucial in enabling that progress to take place. “We had gone as far as we could go with touring all the time, and cranking out singles and our own records,” says frontman Dan McGee, reflecting on the prolific touring and recording pace he and his bandmates have kept up since 2007. “I really wanted to see what would happen if we were just concentrating on material instead of preparing for shows. We were really able to focus on maybe 12, 14 songs—knowing we were going to have to bring them down to 10—and I think it’s a better record for it. We rehearsed ‘My Heart Is a Flame in Reverse’ and ‘Reckless’ for a year before we recorded them. That’s not something we’ve ever had the time to do before.” Recorded in Memphis at Bunker Audio by Andrew McCalla (who also engineered Spider Bags’ seminal 2012 rock and roll party record Shake my Head), Someday Everything Will Be Fine leverages the limitations and glory of the Tascam 388, a vintage recording/mixing device that’s acquired a mythos via its association with legendary records by Dinosaur Jr., East River Pipe, the Black Keys, Ty Segall, and Thee Oh Sees to name a few. The Tascam’s charms are more immediate, with a visceral resonance all its own. “It’s an 8-track machine designed for smaller studios, so your eight tracks are on quarter-inch tape. It squashes the tracks so close together they bleed into each other, which, you know, shouldn’t work, but it does. There’s also a certain compression that happens on those machines that cannot be duplicated. It feels live, but it also sounds like it took place in a studio. It’s not about being an analog purist—it’s about finding the medium that works best for what you’re trying to create, and the band has never sounded better than we sound on this record. I wanted to do as much as we could live, the four of us together playing the guitar solos and tripping effects on the fly like we would at a show. I wanted to capture the performance without the use of infinite tracks and the ability to click away mistakes. You have to be well rehearsed to make a record that way. The album is almost entirely first takes. ‘Burning Sand’ is not only a first take but also the first time we played the song all the way through, with a minute-long instrumental opening that was completely off the cuff. That’s how my favorite rock and roll records were made. It’s the limitations, I think, that create the performance.” Recording in Memphis also lent its own mojo to the album’s sound and feel. According to McGee, “Rock and roll just sounds better there. I swear.” Adding to this sound is the featured playing of Memphis giants Jack Oblivian, John Whittemore, Jana Misener and Krista Wroten-Combest of the Memphis Dawls, and multi-instrumentalist Seth Moody. “It’s a great town with so much individuality and history, musical and otherwise, that can’t help but seep into the music you’re making. I love that city.” Other non-Spider Bag contributing musicians include Patrick Stickles of Titus Andronicus and Matthew Hoopengardner of Austin, Texas, rock and roll legends the Golden Boys. The LP opens with “Reckless,” a strangely organic-sounding sprawl wrought from different parts of songs that McGee had struggled to complete, which peaks with gorgeous guitar fireworks. “The song didn’t seem satisfied until I brought in a couple pieces from other songs I hadn’t finished,” says McGee. “Steve [Oliva, the band’s bassist] said when we finished recording it, ‘There’s seven parts in that song and none of them repeat.’” From that epic build-up, the record returns to earth with the sprightly “Oxcart Blues,” whose twinned guitars a...<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Merge Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-48kHz FLAC (tracks)', '38:27', '105 / 239 / 449 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/j9srnvv9hwu5/Someday_Everything_Will_Be_Fine_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-12 20:21:11.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-12 17:21:11', '2018-08-12 17:21:11'),

To me, that roughly means "the stuff from which stuff generates." It''s a short hand way of evoking all the elements that I''m mashing up in this music. The idea is basically that it''s this collision of genres, and collision of different versions of "American music." It''s also an album that doesn''t fit very neatly into a category of album — studio? live? remix? Maybe all, or none, of the above. This is a new mutant variety of Elephant Micah, better suited to survive the cultural climate of the moment in so-called "Trump''s America." It lives! I guess the lodestone in the process of making this was the kind of global avant garde mood that''s prevalent in a lot of 1980s albums I admire. Things like Joni Mitchell''s Dog Eat Dog and Arthur Russell''s Calling Out of Context. These records where singers were making really eclectic and outward looking productions — writing *through* the process of recording, and literally *play- ing* with technologies that were totally new to them. All the gear that I gathered to make the album was basically discarded or devalued. I got a bunch of stuff from Craigslist that interested me: a cheap FM synth, some Hindustani electronics, and an old three-head tape deck to use as a "poor man''s space echo." The icing on the cake is a one-of-a-kind home- made digital synthesizer called "The Mutant". I worked with my brother to design it. He built it and coded it. The concept of the synth is parallel to the concept of the album itself. It''s an electronic take on "folk" sounds (bends, drones, modal playing) and folk creative approaches (a cobbling together and reformatting of existing elements).<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Western Vinyl', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks)', '32:07', '74.6 / 136 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/n1k81xrhxhpn/Elephant_Micah_-_Genericana_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-12 20:21:17.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-12 17:21:17', '2018-08-12 17:21:17'),

Schubert began this composition in August 1824, or possibly even as late as March 1825. Most of the work on it took place in the summer of 1825, during the longest journey of his life. It took him from Vienna via Linz, Steyr, Gmunden (where he found the scenery "truly heavenly"), Salzburg and then up to Bad Gastein, where he saw some magnificent alpine peaks. The first page of the score manuscript is dated "March 1828" – possibly the month in which he finally completed the work. On November 19 of that same year, Schubert died at the age of only thirty-one. The symphony was premiered posthumously on March 21, 1839 in the Leipzig Gewandhaus, and conducted by the Gewandhaus Kapellmeister at that time - the 30-year-old Felix Mendelssohn.

Possibly it was the high regard in which he held the genre that for so long stopped him from actually completing a quartet of his own – although he had first seriously considered writing one in 1828, it took almost 15 years before he was ready to fully commit to the idea. Once he had done so, there was no returning: during some hectic summer weeks in 1842, a year which is often called ‘Schumann''s chamber music year’, he completed the three string quartets of his Op. 41, presenting them to his wife Clara on her 23rd birthday in September. In her diary she wrote ‘… they delighted me to the utmost. Everything in them is new, clear, expertly worked out and always idiomatic.’ <br><br>The Op.41 quartets were to be the only ones from Schumann''s pen, but this is not to suggest that he was dissatisfied with them: in 1847 he wrote to his publisher that he regarded the quartets ‘as my best work from earlier times’. They are here performed by the Norwegian Engegård Quartet, whose latest release on BIS, of quartets by Grieg and Sibelius, has received critical acclaim, for instance in Gramophone: ‘Those seeking the Grieg/Sibelius pairing in modern sound would be hard pressed to find better.’ <br><br>Schumann gave the three quartets to Clara for her 23rd birthday on 13th September 1842. In the couple’s shared diary she noted: ‘The gift of his three quartets – which he arranged to be performed for me... that very evening... – brought me the greatest joy. About the quartets, all I can say is that they delighted me to the utmost. Everything in them is new, clear, expertly worked out and always idiomatic.’ The fact that Schumann wrote no more string quartets does not indicate that he was dissatisfied with them: in 1847 he wrote to his publisher Härtel that he still regarded the quartets ‘as my best work from earlier times’.

He’s wildly poetic, especially when recounting his dedication to music, and the work that led to this particular collection of delicately passionate songs. “These things became the vehicle by which we traveled, giving us reason to spend most of our lives in a van of uncertainty.” <br><br>Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread is the follow up to 2016’s Mowing — the first record he released under his own name, after fronting psych folk projects Page France and Cotton Jones — June 2017’s Some Twist, and its extension, The Load EP. The sprawling new album was recorded in Benny Yurco’s one-bedroom apartment in downtown Burlington, Vermont. Nau and his collaborators had a cool little set up going in Yurco’s spot — drums and bass took over the bedroom, the guitar amp in the bathroom, Nau’s vocals and piano in the living room, and a vibraphone in the kitchen. It’s the first time one of Nau’s records happened all in one place, and it feels most like a band record than ever before, he says; Nau and this particular group of musicians held it down together as a true team, which is why Nau named the record in their honor. Nothing more was added to it than what was recorded by Nau and the band in Yurco’s apartment. It didn’t feel like the right thing to do to mess with it post-facto, he adds. “It’s a documented live performance. It happened the way it happened, and that’s how it is.” <br><br>You can hear that organicness all across Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread, from the golden-sounding, glibly existential love song “Less Than Positive,” one of the oldest written on album, to the smoky and melancholic “Smudge,” one of the most recent compositions. “It wasn’t until recently that I ever considered revisiting songs from so long ago,” Nau says of playing songs he wrote ages ago, like “Less Than Positive.” “But something happened where I’m now able to appreciate the distance between those songs written long ago, and where I’m at now. It feels like playing someone else’s song.” Nau stresses this theme of time and distance in talking about the record. And those metaphysical thoughts permeate the music, which hangs in an ageless space, somehow classic-sounding and fresh like a cold wind, at the same time. <br><br>The songs on this layered record sound sunny and familiar, like sharing stories and worries with a close friend on a late summer day. In a gorgeous and natural way, he contemplates his own process, those feelings of uncertainty. “Making it too hard just comes easier,” Nau croons on “Funny In Real Life,” an exquisite meditation on creation and self. “Truth is such a beautiful force/And every time we find the chorus/There’s no second-guessing the real/I don’t ever know how I feel.” <br><br>Nau shines when he’s nestled in that medium between melancholy and carefree. He seems to be thinking about the past, present, and future, all at the same time, and his songs move between pain and joy, fires and rivers, faraway stars, icy Saturdays, clouds of smoke, between shelter and flowers in the rain. “And it just keeps going, if it’s done it’s done/Still flow in the flowing, all around the sun,” he sings on “Smudge,” the record’s finale, which is about love, and memories, and loneliness, and apprehension — “Something coming around some bend/Waiting for something to never end” — all at once. It’s all just part of the waves of life; sometimes you get stuck, or things move slower, and sometimes the pace steps up. And that seems to be the gist of Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread — that there are “different movements” in the self, that constantly figuring yourself out is all part of the journey. “As long as love is the motion,” Nau says, “it might get there.” Wherever there is. <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Full Time Hobby', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks)', '40:44', '95.8 / 238 / 436 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/plcnv59i4uzg/Michael_Nau_and_the_Mighty_Thread_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-13 20:18:14.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-13 17:18:14', '2018-08-13 17:18:14'),

Guitarist and lead vocalist Jeremy Stephens, fiddle player Corrina Rose Logston Stephens, and banjo player Kurt Stephenson assembled a list of decades-old songs that they could flawlessly recreate on stage, including some gems from the Stanley Brothers.

With that newfound perspective, High Fidelity handily won that year''s contest.<br><br>To all but the most dyed-in-the-wool bluegrass and old-time music devotees, the music on High Fidelity''s Rebel Records debut ''Hills And Home'' will come as a revelation.

The band also mines gems from lesser known  but no less worthy  acts such as the Lilly Brothers &amp; Don Stover, Wade Mainer, Jim &amp; Jesse, and the Country Gentlemen.<br><br>High Fidelity wooed fans and industry professionals alike when they mounted the stage of last year''s International Bluegrass Music Association showcase.

Comprised of brothers Collin and Kyle Rausch and best friends Konnor Ervin, Kyle Little and Ross Brown, Shy Boys are the heartland’s answer to The Beach Boys had Alex Chilton been on guitar. <br><br>But if a harmony falls into a microphone in the middle of America does anyone really hear it? Some do. Take for instance Shy Boys’ 2014 self-titled debut on local Kansas City label, High Dive Records - I first came across this album while living in Los Angeles and catching wind of a band from my home town that I was told could "actually sing," and after the first spin, through the muddy fidelity, man, could they actually sing. <br><br>Shy Boys’ history isn''t too dissimilar from any other Midwestern band. Like the many Replacements or Husker Düs before them - they exist neither here nor there, but instead, somewhere anonymously in the middle. And though you may not find the same opportunity floating in the middle as one would Here or There, you are allotted a certain amount of time and space to grow both yourself and your craft into what you want it to be. Over the past four years, that is exactly what Shy Boys have done and that is what brings us here today. <br><br>On August 3, 2018, the world will see the release of their second record, Bell House, out on legendary and globally cherished record label Polyvinyl, bringing both their profile and music to the surface for the first time. <br><br>The album’s title is taken from the band’s beloved headquarters - the old house on Bell Street in Kansas City where they lived together for the better part of 5 years. <br><br>“‘Lived’ is a loose term,” says lead songwriter Collin. “It was more like a bum den than anything else. There was a giant hole in the floor of the kitchen that had a piece of plywood over it. In the backyard, weeds got like 6 feet high in the summer. It was its own thriving biome. We lived in trash.” <br><br>Musically, Collin describes the songs on Bell House taking shape through “a group of guys trying to get through some sort of mutual identity crisis. The lifestyle became overwhelming and really seeped into the music.” <br><br>In the time since the release of ST, Collin saw himself falling in love and getting married, leaving the old house on Bell Street, and moving back into his mom’s house with his wife in a suburb of the city. It''s here where the songs of Bell House were born. Being back under the same roof he had grown up in where there was “still writing on the walls from childhood," Rausch found himself reflective and looking out at his life as a whole. <br><br>Take closing track “Champion” for instance, a song Collin says is dedicated to his and Kyle’s mother. “It’s just a note saying that she took care of us when we were young, and now it’s time for us to be there and take care of her.” <br><br>The reflective spirit sprinkled throughout the album is also evident on lead single, “Take The Doggie,” a bouncy, guitar driven track centered around wanting to secretly rescue their neighbor’s dog from an abusive owner, or on album highlight “Evil Sin,” which tackles the memory of drummer/bassist Konnor Ervin getting robbed. <br><br>But through all of this, Rausch kept his passion in his band, if even for nothing more than to - in his own words - have an excuse to keep hanging out with his brother and best friends. <br><br>“I have to keep Shy Boys alive to have a regular excuse to hang out with them,” says Collin. “To keep the band alive, I have to write songs. To be able to travel with my buddies, there has to be a new record.” <br><br>There is an old term that''s kicked around in country music called a "blood harmony" - in which two people in the same blood line, usually siblings, harmonize with one another in real time. Perhaps that is Shy Boys’ magic touch, putting them just a notch above all the other angels out there in the indie rock choir, and it makes sense, though no longer practicing evangelicals, Collin and Kyle grew up singing besides their parents in their church choir, so their keen sense of harmony is nothing new to them, but instead a life practice devoted to the voice as an instrument. <br><br>The result is Bell House, and the result is beautiful. There is something sensitive to the touch about this album, which is perhaps another way of saying that, well - Shy Boys are indeed Shy Boys. I envision the band as a solid unit, with each moving part as an equal. There is a heavy sense of family in everything they do both, literally and figuratively. Bruce Springsteen''s 1980 song “Highway Patrolman” always seems to come to mind; <br><br>"Yeah me and Franky out laughing and drinking, <br>Nothing feels better than blood on blood." <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Polyvinyl Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks)', '22:23', '53.7 / 136 / 247 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/3nyji7ju6uir/Shy_Boys_-_Bell_House_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-13 20:19:47.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-13 17:19:48', '2018-08-13 17:19:48'),

He began his professional career as a musician in 1967 when he was recruited to join The Tennors, a vocal group who had already scored a big hit with "Pressure And The Slide" on Coxsone''s Studio One label. The group scored another massive hit in 1968 with "Ride Your Donkey" with more hits following in 1973 when Ronnie led the group on "Weather Report" for Duke Reid''s Treasure Isle label and "Take Heed" for Bunny Lee. Both records sold well, and with encouragement from Bunny Lee, Ronnie left the group to pursue a solo career. During the mid-''70s Ronnie was among the most prolific of Jamaica''s vocalists, recording over 100 titles for a variety of labels and producers including a large body of work for Bunny Lee. By the late ''70s Davis was producing his own work for release on his own On Top label while continuing to work for other producers. He bonded with producer Lloyd Campbell who released some of Davis'' best work on the Spider Man label and included "Won''t You Come Home" which became a minor hit due in part to the superb rhythm track from The Revolutionaires.

They added a third singer, Lloyd Ricketts, and Campbell and continued recording.

Gulp are on a journey, a state of perpetual transition. The band make mini Kraut-pop epics, informed equally by the sun flares of the Californian desert and the drizzle of pure, sweet Scottish rain and northern light. Debut album ‘Season Sun’ was a home-grown delight, a ramshackle, endlessly inventive selection of dreamy psychedelic nuggets to watch the world flash past.<br><br>New album ‘All Good Wishes’ half-inches its title from a vintage Scottish postcard, and it’s emblematic of the changes the pair have undergone. “I think all through making this record we were looking at relocating,” Guto explains. “Whereas the first record was more of a road trip this is possibly a bit more focussed on home, and focussed on where we’re from and where we’re looking to go to. It’s partly a farewell to Wales, and hello to Scotland.”<br><br>The record was largely built in South Wales, a three-year process that saw the band retreat to their basement for endless sonic incisions and revisions. A broader, wider, perhaps bolder experience than their debut, ‘All Good Wishes’ is rooted in fantastic pop songwriting, in creating three minute vignettes that express complex ideas in a simple, accessible, endlessly fascinating way. Endlessly restrained yet infinitely open, each Gulp track is like a world in miniature, ideas borrowed from Krautrock and electronic culture slimmed down into these infinitely enjoyable pop songs.<br><br>Minimalist Kraut-pop with a dreamy, Cocteau Twins esque vibe, recent single ‘Morning Velvet Sky’ was a potent introduction to the duo’s ever-shifting realm. Following on from introductory cut ‘Search For Your Love’ - released on Tim Burgess’ esteemed O Genesis label - ‘Morning Velvet Sky’ was mixed by Luke Abbott, and the producer cast his eye over the record as a whole during the final mixdown in his home studio in Norwich<br><br>From Cardiff to Norwich and onwards to the Scottish East Coast, Gulp are tracing sonic ley-lines, empowering themselves, plugging into often over-looked artistic communities to fuel their next move. “We spent a lot of time on road trips listening to music, experiencing and enjoying different landscapes” he explains. “It’s especially apt in these times to see the good side of human nature; despite what the media portrays, people are generally sound, and it’s great be reminded of that in day-to-day living.<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'E.L.K.

Rollin'' With the Flow', '<!--QuoteEBegin-->Four years after releasing their Merge debut, Frozen Letter, Spider Bags have returned with Someday Everything Will Be Fine, an LP that ascends to new levels of aural punch and perspective. The years that elapsed between records were crucial in enabling that progress to take place. “We had gone as far as we could go with touring all the time, and cranking out singles and our own records,” says frontman Dan McGee, reflecting on the prolific touring and recording pace he and his bandmates have kept up since 2007. “I really wanted to see what would happen if we were just concentrating on material instead of preparing for shows. We were really able to focus on maybe 12, 14 songs—knowing we were going to have to bring them down to 10—and I think it’s a better record for it. We rehearsed ‘My Heart Is a Flame in Reverse’ and ‘Reckless’ for a year before we recorded them. That’s not something we’ve ever had the time to do before.” Recorded in Memphis at Bunker Audio by Andrew McCalla (who also engineered Spider Bags’ seminal 2012 rock and roll party record Shake my Head), Someday Everything Will Be Fine leverages the limitations and glory of the Tascam 388, a vintage recording/mixing device that’s acquired a mythos via its association with legendary records by Dinosaur Jr., East River Pipe, the Black Keys, Ty Segall, and Thee Oh Sees to name a few. The Tascam’s charms are more immediate, with a visceral resonance all its own. “It’s an 8-track machine designed for smaller studios, so your eight tracks are on quarter-inch tape. It squashes the tracks so close together they bleed into each other, which, you know, shouldn’t work, but it does. There’s also a certain compression that happens on those machines that cannot be duplicated. It feels live, but it also sounds like it took place in a studio. It’s not about being an analog purist—it’s about finding the medium that works best for what you’re trying to create, and the band has never sounded better than we sound on this record. I wanted to do as much as we could live, the four of us together playing the guitar solos and tripping effects on the fly like we would at a show. I wanted to capture the performance without the use of infinite tracks and the ability to click away mistakes. You have to be well rehearsed to make a record that way. The album is almost entirely first takes. ‘Burning Sand’ is not only a first take but also the first time we played the song all the way through, with a minute-long instrumental opening that was completely off the cuff. That’s how my favorite rock and roll records were made. It’s the limitations, I think, that create the performance.” Recording in Memphis also lent its own mojo to the album’s sound and feel. According to McGee, “Rock and roll just sounds better there. I swear.” Adding to this sound is the featured playing of Memphis giants Jack Oblivian, John Whittemore, Jana Misener and Krista Wroten-Combest of the Memphis Dawls, and multi-instrumentalist Seth Moody. “It’s a great town with so much individuality and history, musical and otherwise, that can’t help but seep into the music you’re making. I love that city.” Other non-Spider Bag contributing musicians include Patrick Stickles of Titus Andronicus and Matthew Hoopengardner of Austin, Texas, rock and roll legends the Golden Boys. The LP opens with “Reckless,” a strangely organic-sounding sprawl wrought from different parts of songs that McGee had struggled to complete, which peaks with gorgeous guitar fireworks. “The song didn’t seem satisfied until I brought in a couple pieces from other songs I hadn’t finished,” says McGee. “Steve [Oliva, the band’s bassist] said when we finished recording it, ‘There’s seven parts in that song and none of them repeat.’” From that epic build-up, the record returns to earth with the sprightly “Oxcart Blues,” whose twinned guitars a...<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Merge Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-48kHz FLAC (tracks)', '38:27', '105 / 239 / 449 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/j9srnvv9hwu5/Someday_Everything_Will_Be_Fine_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-13 20:21:11.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-13 17:21:11', '2018-08-13 17:21:11'),

To me, that roughly means "the stuff from which stuff generates." It''s a short hand way of evoking all the elements that I''m mashing up in this music. The idea is basically that it''s this collision of genres, and collision of different versions of "American music." It''s also an album that doesn''t fit very neatly into a category of album — studio? live? remix? Maybe all, or none, of the above. This is a new mutant variety of Elephant Micah, better suited to survive the cultural climate of the moment in so-called "Trump''s America." It lives! I guess the lodestone in the process of making this was the kind of global avant garde mood that''s prevalent in a lot of 1980s albums I admire. Things like Joni Mitchell''s Dog Eat Dog and Arthur Russell''s Calling Out of Context. These records where singers were making really eclectic and outward looking productions — writing *through* the process of recording, and literally *play- ing* with technologies that were totally new to them. All the gear that I gathered to make the album was basically discarded or devalued. I got a bunch of stuff from Craigslist that interested me: a cheap FM synth, some Hindustani electronics, and an old three-head tape deck to use as a "poor man''s space echo." The icing on the cake is a one-of-a-kind home- made digital synthesizer called "The Mutant". I worked with my brother to design it. He built it and coded it. The concept of the synth is parallel to the concept of the album itself. It''s an electronic take on "folk" sounds (bends, drones, modal playing) and folk creative approaches (a cobbling together and reformatting of existing elements).<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Western Vinyl', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks)', '32:07', '74.6 / 136 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/n1k81xrhxhpn/Elephant_Micah_-_Genericana_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-13 20:21:16.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-13 17:21:16', '2018-08-13 17:21:16'),

Recently signed to Epic Records, Meghan joined forces with Grammy-nominated producer/songwriter Kevin Kadish (Miley Cyrus, Jason Mraz) for her infectious debut single, "All About That Bass," a playful, empowering and unapologetic pop anthem that encourages girls to ignore the Barbie doll standard of beauty and love themselves inside and out.<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Epic', NULL, '24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks)', '45:57', '547 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/yl5e6mkt10tc/Meghan_Trainor_-_Title_Deluxe.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-13 20:22:12.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-13 17:22:12', '2018-08-13 17:22:12'),

Schubert began this composition in August 1824, or possibly even as late as March 1825. Most of the work on it took place in the summer of 1825, during the longest journey of his life. It took him from Vienna via Linz, Steyr, Gmunden (where he found the scenery "truly heavenly"), Salzburg and then up to Bad Gastein, where he saw some magnificent alpine peaks. The first page of the score manuscript is dated "March 1828" – possibly the month in which he finally completed the work. On November 19 of that same year, Schubert died at the age of only thirty-one. The symphony was premiered posthumously on March 21, 1839 in the Leipzig Gewandhaus, and conducted by the Gewandhaus Kapellmeister at that time - the 30-year-old Felix Mendelssohn.

But Klengel was an important early-Romantic composer and celebrated piano virtuoso, with a reputation that stretched from St Petersburg to London. This first recording of his piano and chamber music reveals a personality with a strong lyrical impulse, somewhere between Field, Mendelssohn and Chopin, all three of whom he knew personally. Founded in 2016, Trio Klengel is named after August Klengel with the purpose of promoting his works. The ensemble decided to continue the work of the original Klengel Trio, founded in 1912. This trio consisted of the three daughters of the composer Julius Klengel, a relative of August Klengel.

Possibly it was the high regard in which he held the genre that for so long stopped him from actually completing a quartet of his own – although he had first seriously considered writing one in 1828, it took almost 15 years before he was ready to fully commit to the idea. Once he had done so, there was no returning: during some hectic summer weeks in 1842, a year which is often called ‘Schumann''s chamber music year’, he completed the three string quartets of his Op. 41, presenting them to his wife Clara on her 23rd birthday in September. In her diary she wrote ‘… they delighted me to the utmost. Everything in them is new, clear, expertly worked out and always idiomatic.’ <br><br>The Op.41 quartets were to be the only ones from Schumann''s pen, but this is not to suggest that he was dissatisfied with them: in 1847 he wrote to his publisher that he regarded the quartets ‘as my best work from earlier times’. They are here performed by the Norwegian Engegård Quartet, whose latest release on BIS, of quartets by Grieg and Sibelius, has received critical acclaim, for instance in Gramophone: ‘Those seeking the Grieg/Sibelius pairing in modern sound would be hard pressed to find better.’ <br><br>Schumann gave the three quartets to Clara for her 23rd birthday on 13th September 1842. In the couple’s shared diary she noted: ‘The gift of his three quartets – which he arranged to be performed for me... that very evening... – brought me the greatest joy. About the quartets, all I can say is that they delighted me to the utmost. Everything in them is new, clear, expertly worked out and always idiomatic.’ The fact that Schumann wrote no more string quartets does not indicate that he was dissatisfied with them: in 1847 he wrote to his publisher Härtel that he still regarded the quartets ‘as my best work from earlier times’. And posterity has unanimously shared the view of the eminent Viennese critic Eduard Hanslick that the three Op. 41 quartets ‘are among the all-time jewels of chamber music’.

He’s wildly poetic, especially when recounting his dedication to music, and the work that led to this particular collection of delicately passionate songs. “These things became the vehicle by which we traveled, giving us reason to spend most of our lives in a van of uncertainty.” <br><br>Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread is the follow up to 2016’s Mowing — the first record he released under his own name, after fronting psych folk projects Page France and Cotton Jones — June 2017’s Some Twist, and its extension, The Load EP. The sprawling new album was recorded in Benny Yurco’s one-bedroom apartment in downtown Burlington, Vermont. Nau and his collaborators had a cool little set up going in Yurco’s spot — drums and bass took over the bedroom, the guitar amp in the bathroom, Nau’s vocals and piano in the living room, and a vibraphone in the kitchen. It’s the first time one of Nau’s records happened all in one place, and it feels most like a band record than ever before, he says; Nau and this particular group of musicians held it down together as a true team, which is why Nau named the record in their honor. Nothing more was added to it than what was recorded by Nau and the band in Yurco’s apartment. It didn’t feel like the right thing to do to mess with it post-facto, he adds. “It’s a documented live performance. It happened the way it happened, and that’s how it is.” <br><br>You can hear that organicness all across Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread, from the golden-sounding, glibly existential love song “Less Than Positive,” one of the oldest written on album, to the smoky and melancholic “Smudge,” one of the most recent compositions. “It wasn’t until recently that I ever considered revisiting songs from so long ago,” Nau says of playing songs he wrote ages ago, like “Less Than Positive.” “But something happened where I’m now able to appreciate the distance between those songs written long ago, and where I’m at now. It feels like playing someone else’s song.” Nau stresses this theme of time and distance in talking about the record. And those metaphysical thoughts permeate the music, which hangs in an ageless space, somehow classic-sounding and fresh like a cold wind, at the same time. <br><br>The songs on this layered record sound sunny and familiar, like sharing stories and worries with a close friend on a late summer day. In a gorgeous and natural way, he contemplates his own process, those feelings of uncertainty. “Making it too hard just comes easier,” Nau croons on “Funny In Real Life,” an exquisite meditation on creation and self. “Truth is such a beautiful force/And every time we find the chorus/There’s no second-guessing the real/I don’t ever know how I feel.” <br><br>Nau shines when he’s nestled in that medium between melancholy and carefree. He seems to be thinking about the past, present, and future, all at the same time, and his songs move between pain and joy, fires and rivers, faraway stars, icy Saturdays, clouds of smoke, between shelter and flowers in the rain. “And it just keeps going, if it’s done it’s done/Still flow in the flowing, all around the sun,” he sings on “Smudge,” the record’s finale, which is about love, and memories, and loneliness, and apprehension — “Something coming around some bend/Waiting for something to never end” — all at once. It’s all just part of the waves of life; sometimes you get stuck, or things move slower, and sometimes the pace steps up. And that seems to be the gist of Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread — that there are “different movements” in the self, that constantly figuring yourself out is all part of the journey. “As long as love is the motion,” Nau says, “it might get there.” Wherever there is. <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Full Time Hobby', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks)', '40:44', '95.8 / 238 / 436 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/plcnv59i4uzg/Michael_Nau_and_the_Mighty_Thread_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-14 20:18:15.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-14 17:18:15', '2018-08-14 17:18:15'),

Comprised of brothers Collin and Kyle Rausch and best friends Konnor Ervin, Kyle Little and Ross Brown, Shy Boys are the heartland’s answer to The Beach Boys had Alex Chilton been on guitar. <br><br>But if a harmony falls into a microphone in the middle of America does anyone really hear it? Some do. Take for instance Shy Boys’ 2014 self-titled debut on local Kansas City label, High Dive Records - I first came across this album while living in Los Angeles and catching wind of a band from my home town that I was told could "actually sing," and after the first spin, through the muddy fidelity, man, could they actually sing. <br><br>Shy Boys’ history isn''t too dissimilar from any other Midwestern band. Like the many Replacements or Husker Düs before them - they exist neither here nor there, but instead, somewhere anonymously in the middle. And though you may not find the same opportunity floating in the middle as one would Here or There, you are allotted a certain amount of time and space to grow both yourself and your craft into what you want it to be. Over the past four years, that is exactly what Shy Boys have done and that is what brings us here today. <br><br>On August 3, 2018, the world will see the release of their second record, Bell House, out on legendary and globally cherished record label Polyvinyl, bringing both their profile and music to the surface for the first time. <br><br>The album’s title is taken from the band’s beloved headquarters - the old house on Bell Street in Kansas City where they lived together for the better part of 5 years. <br><br>“‘Lived’ is a loose term,” says lead songwriter Collin. “It was more like a bum den than anything else. There was a giant hole in the floor of the kitchen that had a piece of plywood over it. In the backyard, weeds got like 6 feet high in the summer. It was its own thriving biome. We lived in trash.” <br><br>Musically, Collin describes the songs on Bell House taking shape through “a group of guys trying to get through some sort of mutual identity crisis. The lifestyle became overwhelming and really seeped into the music.” <br><br>In the time since the release of ST, Collin saw himself falling in love and getting married, leaving the old house on Bell Street, and moving back into his mom’s house with his wife in a suburb of the city. It''s here where the songs of Bell House were born. Being back under the same roof he had grown up in where there was “still writing on the walls from childhood," Rausch found himself reflective and looking out at his life as a whole. <br><br>Take closing track “Champion” for instance, a song Collin says is dedicated to his and Kyle’s mother. “It’s just a note saying that she took care of us when we were young, and now it’s time for us to be there and take care of her.” <br><br>The reflective spirit sprinkled throughout the album is also evident on lead single, “Take The Doggie,” a bouncy, guitar driven track centered around wanting to secretly rescue their neighbor’s dog from an abusive owner, or on album highlight “Evil Sin,” which tackles the memory of drummer/bassist Konnor Ervin getting robbed. <br><br>But through all of this, Rausch kept his passion in his band, if even for nothing more than to - in his own words - have an excuse to keep hanging out with his brother and best friends. <br><br>“I have to keep Shy Boys alive to have a regular excuse to hang out with them,” says Collin. “To keep the band alive, I have to write songs. To be able to travel with my buddies, there has to be a new record.” <br><br>There is an old term that''s kicked around in country music called a "blood harmony" - in which two people in the same blood line, usually siblings, harmonize with one another in real time. Perhaps that is Shy Boys’ magic touch, putting them just a notch above all the other angels out there in the indie rock choir, and it makes sense, though no longer practicing evangelicals, Collin and Kyle grew up singing besides their parents in their church choir, so their keen sense of harmony is nothing new to them, but instead a life practice devoted to the voice as an instrument. <br><br>The result is Bell House, and the result is beautiful. There is something sensitive to the touch about this album, which is perhaps another way of saying that, well - Shy Boys are indeed Shy Boys. I envision the band as a solid unit, with each moving part as an equal. There is a heavy sense of family in everything they do both, literally and figuratively.

The group scored another massive hit in 1968 with "Ride Your Donkey" with more hits following in 1973 when Ronnie led the group on "Weather Report" for Duke Reid''s Treasure Isle label and "Take Heed" for Bunny Lee. Both records sold well, and with encouragement from Bunny Lee, Ronnie left the group to pursue a solo career.

By the late ''70s Davis was producing his own work for release on his own On Top label while continuing to work for other producers. He bonded with producer Lloyd Campbell who released some of Davis'' best work on the Spider Man label and included "Won''t You Come Home" which became a minor hit due in part to the superb rhythm track from The Revolutionaires. Ronnie loved this record, and soon returned to Lloyd Campbell with Keith Porter, a friend from Savannah La Mar who had written a new song for the rhythm.

They added a third singer, Lloyd Ricketts, and Campbell and continued recording.

Gulp are on a journey, a state of perpetual transition. The band make mini Kraut-pop epics, informed equally by the sun flares of the Californian desert and the drizzle of pure, sweet Scottish rain and northern light. Debut album ‘Season Sun’ was a home-grown delight, a ramshackle, endlessly inventive selection of dreamy psychedelic nuggets to watch the world flash past.<br><br>New album ‘All Good Wishes’ half-inches its title from a vintage Scottish postcard, and it’s emblematic of the changes the pair have undergone. “I think all through making this record we were looking at relocating,” Guto explains. “Whereas the first record was more of a road trip this is possibly a bit more focussed on home, and focussed on where we’re from and where we’re looking to go to. It’s partly a farewell to Wales, and hello to Scotland.”<br><br>The record was largely built in South Wales, a three-year process that saw the band retreat to their basement for endless sonic incisions and revisions. A broader, wider, perhaps bolder experience than their debut, ‘All Good Wishes’ is rooted in fantastic pop songwriting, in creating three minute vignettes that express complex ideas in a simple, accessible, endlessly fascinating way. Endlessly restrained yet infinitely open, each Gulp track is like a world in miniature, ideas borrowed from Krautrock and electronic culture slimmed down into these infinitely enjoyable pop songs.<br><br>Minimalist Kraut-pop with a dreamy, Cocteau Twins esque vibe, recent single ‘Morning Velvet Sky’ was a potent introduction to the duo’s ever-shifting realm.

Rollin'' With the Flow', '<!--QuoteEBegin-->Four years after releasing their Merge debut, Frozen Letter, Spider Bags have returned with Someday Everything Will Be Fine, an LP that ascends to new levels of aural punch and perspective. The years that elapsed between records were crucial in enabling that progress to take place. “We had gone as far as we could go with touring all the time, and cranking out singles and our own records,” says frontman Dan McGee, reflecting on the prolific touring and recording pace he and his bandmates have kept up since 2007. “I really wanted to see what would happen if we were just concentrating on material instead of preparing for shows. We were really able to focus on maybe 12, 14 songs—knowing we were going to have to bring them down to 10—and I think it’s a better record for it. We rehearsed ‘My Heart Is a Flame in Reverse’ and ‘Reckless’ for a year before we recorded them. That’s not something we’ve ever had the time to do before.” Recorded in Memphis at Bunker Audio by Andrew McCalla (who also engineered Spider Bags’ seminal 2012 rock and roll party record Shake my Head), Someday Everything Will Be Fine leverages the limitations and glory of the Tascam 388, a vintage recording/mixing device that’s acquired a mythos via its association with legendary records by Dinosaur Jr., East River Pipe, the Black Keys, Ty Segall, and Thee Oh Sees to name a few. The Tascam’s charms are more immediate, with a visceral resonance all its own. “It’s an 8-track machine designed for smaller studios, so your eight tracks are on quarter-inch tape. It squashes the tracks so close together they bleed into each other, which, you know, shouldn’t work, but it does. There’s also a certain compression that happens on those machines that cannot be duplicated. It feels live, but it also sounds like it took place in a studio. It’s not about being an analog purist—it’s about finding the medium that works best for what you’re trying to create, and the band has never sounded better than we sound on this record. I wanted to do as much as we could live, the four of us together playing the guitar solos and tripping effects on the fly like we would at a show. I wanted to capture the performance without the use of infinite tracks and the ability to click away mistakes. You have to be well rehearsed to make a record that way. The album is almost entirely first takes. ‘Burning Sand’ is not only a first take but also the first time we played the song all the way through, with a minute-long instrumental opening that was completely off the cuff. That’s how my favorite rock and roll records were made. It’s the limitations, I think, that create the performance.” Recording in Memphis also lent its own mojo to the album’s sound and feel. According to McGee, “Rock and roll just sounds better there. I swear.” Adding to this sound is the featured playing of Memphis giants Jack Oblivian, John Whittemore, Jana Misener and Krista Wroten-Combest of the Memphis Dawls, and multi-instrumentalist Seth Moody. “It’s a great town with so much individuality and history, musical and otherwise, that can’t help but seep into the music you’re making. I love that city.” Other non-Spider Bag contributing musicians include Patrick Stickles of Titus Andronicus and Matthew Hoopengardner of Austin, Texas, rock and roll legends the Golden Boys. The LP opens with “Reckless,” a strangely organic-sounding sprawl wrought from different parts of songs that McGee had struggled to complete, which peaks with gorgeous guitar fireworks. “The song didn’t seem satisfied until I brought in a couple pieces from other songs I hadn’t finished,” says McGee. “Steve [Oliva, the band’s bassist] said when we finished recording it, ‘There’s seven parts in that song and none of them repeat.’” From that epic build-up, the record returns to earth with the sprightly “Oxcart Blues,” whose twinned guitars a...<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Merge Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-48kHz FLAC (tracks)', '38:27', '105 / 239 / 449 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/j9srnvv9hwu5/Someday_Everything_Will_Be_Fine_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-14 20:21:13.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-14 17:21:13', '2018-08-14 17:21:13'),

To me, that roughly means "the stuff from which stuff generates." It''s a short hand way of evoking all the elements that I''m mashing up in this music. The idea is basically that it''s this collision of genres, and collision of different versions of "American music." It''s also an album that doesn''t fit very neatly into a category of album — studio? live? remix? Maybe all, or none, of the above. This is a new mutant variety of Elephant Micah, better suited to survive the cultural climate of the moment in so-called "Trump''s America." It lives! I guess the lodestone in the process of making this was the kind of global avant garde mood that''s prevalent in a lot of 1980s albums I admire. Things like Joni Mitchell''s Dog Eat Dog and Arthur Russell''s Calling Out of Context. These records where singers were making really eclectic and outward looking productions — writing *through* the process of recording, and literally *play- ing* with technologies that were totally new to them. All the gear that I gathered to make the album was basically discarded or devalued. I got a bunch of stuff from Craigslist that interested me: a cheap FM synth, some Hindustani electronics, and an old three-head tape deck to use as a "poor man''s space echo." The icing on the cake is a one-of-a-kind home- made digital synthesizer called "The Mutant". I worked with my brother to design it. He built it and coded it. The concept of the synth is parallel to the concept of the album itself. It''s an electronic take on "folk" sounds (bends, drones, modal playing) and folk creative approaches (a cobbling together and reformatting of existing elements).<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Western Vinyl', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks)', '32:07', '74.6 / 136 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/n1k81xrhxhpn/Elephant_Micah_-_Genericana_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-14 20:21:18.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-14 17:21:19', '2018-08-14 17:21:19'),

Schubert began this composition in August 1824, or possibly even as late as March 1825. Most of the work on it took place in the summer of 1825, during the longest journey of his life. It took him from Vienna via Linz, Steyr, Gmunden (where he found the scenery "truly heavenly"), Salzburg and then up to Bad Gastein, where he saw some magnificent alpine peaks. The first page of the score manuscript is dated "March 1828" – possibly the month in which he finally completed the work. On November 19 of that same year, Schubert died at the age of only thirty-one. The symphony was premiered posthumously on March 21, 1839 in the Leipzig Gewandhaus, and conducted by the Gewandhaus Kapellmeister at that time - the 30-year-old Felix Mendelssohn.

Possibly it was the high regard in which he held the genre that for so long stopped him from actually completing a quartet of his own – although he had first seriously considered writing one in 1828, it took almost 15 years before he was ready to fully commit to the idea. Once he had done so, there was no returning: during some hectic summer weeks in 1842, a year which is often called ‘Schumann''s chamber music year’, he completed the three string quartets of his Op. 41, presenting them to his wife Clara on her 23rd birthday in September. In her diary she wrote ‘… they delighted me to the utmost. Everything in them is new, clear, expertly worked out and always idiomatic.’ <br><br>The Op.41 quartets were to be the only ones from Schumann''s pen, but this is not to suggest that he was dissatisfied with them: in 1847 he wrote to his publisher that he regarded the quartets ‘as my best work from earlier times’. They are here performed by the Norwegian Engegård Quartet, whose latest release on BIS, of quartets by Grieg and Sibelius, has received critical acclaim, for instance in Gramophone: ‘Those seeking the Grieg/Sibelius pairing in modern sound would be hard pressed to find better.’ <br><br>Schumann gave the three quartets to Clara for her 23rd birthday on 13th September 1842. In the couple’s shared diary she noted: ‘The gift of his three quartets – which he arranged to be performed for me... that very evening... – brought me the greatest joy. About the quartets, all I can say is that they delighted me to the utmost. Everything in them is new, clear, expertly worked out and always idiomatic.’ The fact that Schumann wrote no more string quartets does not indicate that he was dissatisfied with them: in 1847 he wrote to his publisher Härtel that he still regarded the quartets ‘as my best work from earlier times’. And posterity has unanimously shared the view of the eminent Viennese critic Eduard Hanslick that the three Op. 41 quartets ‘are among the all-time jewels of chamber music’.

Repin won his first competition at the age of five, and at 17, he was the youngest ever winner of the prestigious Queen Elisabeth Competition. This is Repin’s first commercial release of the FIrst Violin Concerto This performance of Chout is narrated in English by stage and screen legend Simon Callow. Callow brings to life the story of a buffoon who, through many tricks and deceptions, outwits seven other buffoons. This release includes the full score of the 1921 ballet Chout. The full ballet is rarely performed and has only been recorded a handful of times in its history, with the first ever recording in 1985. Alexander Lazarev has been praised for his interpretations of Prokofiev.

He’s wildly poetic, especially when recounting his dedication to music, and the work that led to this particular collection of delicately passionate songs. “These things became the vehicle by which we traveled, giving us reason to spend most of our lives in a van of uncertainty.” <br><br>Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread is the follow up to 2016’s Mowing — the first record he released under his own name, after fronting psych folk projects Page France and Cotton Jones — June 2017’s Some Twist, and its extension, The Load EP. The sprawling new album was recorded in Benny Yurco’s one-bedroom apartment in downtown Burlington, Vermont. Nau and his collaborators had a cool little set up going in Yurco’s spot — drums and bass took over the bedroom, the guitar amp in the bathroom, Nau’s vocals and piano in the living room, and a vibraphone in the kitchen. It’s the first time one of Nau’s records happened all in one place, and it feels most like a band record than ever before, he says; Nau and this particular group of musicians held it down together as a true team, which is why Nau named the record in their honor. Nothing more was added to it than what was recorded by Nau and the band in Yurco’s apartment. It didn’t feel like the right thing to do to mess with it post-facto, he adds. “It’s a documented live performance. It happened the way it happened, and that’s how it is.” <br><br>You can hear that organicness all across Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread, from the golden-sounding, glibly existential love song “Less Than Positive,” one of the oldest written on album, to the smoky and melancholic “Smudge,” one of the most recent compositions. “It wasn’t until recently that I ever considered revisiting songs from so long ago,” Nau says of playing songs he wrote ages ago, like “Less Than Positive.” “But something happened where I’m now able to appreciate the distance between those songs written long ago, and where I’m at now. It feels like playing someone else’s song.” Nau stresses this theme of time and distance in talking about the record. And those metaphysical thoughts permeate the music, which hangs in an ageless space, somehow classic-sounding and fresh like a cold wind, at the same time. <br><br>The songs on this layered record sound sunny and familiar, like sharing stories and worries with a close friend on a late summer day. In a gorgeous and natural way, he contemplates his own process, those feelings of uncertainty. “Making it too hard just comes easier,” Nau croons on “Funny In Real Life,” an exquisite meditation on creation and self. “Truth is such a beautiful force/And every time we find the chorus/There’s no second-guessing the real/I don’t ever know how I feel.” <br><br>Nau shines when he’s nestled in that medium between melancholy and carefree. He seems to be thinking about the past, present, and future, all at the same time, and his songs move between pain and joy, fires and rivers, faraway stars, icy Saturdays, clouds of smoke, between shelter and flowers in the rain. “And it just keeps going, if it’s done it’s done/Still flow in the flowing, all around the sun,” he sings on “Smudge,” the record’s finale, which is about love, and memories, and loneliness, and apprehension — “Something coming around some bend/Waiting for something to never end” — all at once. It’s all just part of the waves of life; sometimes you get stuck, or things move slower, and sometimes the pace steps up. And that seems to be the gist of Michael Nau &amp; The Mighty Thread — that there are “different movements” in the self, that constantly figuring yourself out is all part of the journey. “As long as love is the motion,” Nau says, “it might get there.” Wherever there is. <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Full Time Hobby', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks)', '40:44', '95.8 / 238 / 436 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/plcnv59i4uzg/Michael_Nau_and_the_Mighty_Thread_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-15 20:18:15.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-15 17:18:15', '2018-08-15 17:18:15'),

Comprised of brothers Collin and Kyle Rausch and best friends Konnor Ervin, Kyle Little and Ross Brown, Shy Boys are the heartland’s answer to The Beach Boys had Alex Chilton been on guitar. <br><br>But if a harmony falls into a microphone in the middle of America does anyone really hear it? Some do. Take for instance Shy Boys’ 2014 self-titled debut on local Kansas City label, High Dive Records - I first came across this album while living in Los Angeles and catching wind of a band from my home town that I was told could "actually sing," and after the first spin, through the muddy fidelity, man, could they actually sing. <br><br>Shy Boys’ history isn''t too dissimilar from any other Midwestern band. Like the many Replacements or Husker Düs before them - they exist neither here nor there, but instead, somewhere anonymously in the middle. And though you may not find the same opportunity floating in the middle as one would Here or There, you are allotted a certain amount of time and space to grow both yourself and your craft into what you want it to be. Over the past four years, that is exactly what Shy Boys have done and that is what brings us here today. <br><br>On August 3, 2018, the world will see the release of their second record, Bell House, out on legendary and globally cherished record label Polyvinyl, bringing both their profile and music to the surface for the first time. <br><br>The album’s title is taken from the band’s beloved headquarters - the old house on Bell Street in Kansas City where they lived together for the better part of 5 years. <br><br>“‘Lived’ is a loose term,” says lead songwriter Collin. “It was more like a bum den than anything else. There was a giant hole in the floor of the kitchen that had a piece of plywood over it. In the backyard, weeds got like 6 feet high in the summer. It was its own thriving biome. We lived in trash.” <br><br>Musically, Collin describes the songs on Bell House taking shape through “a group of guys trying to get through some sort of mutual identity crisis. The lifestyle became overwhelming and really seeped into the music.” <br><br>In the time since the release of ST, Collin saw himself falling in love and getting married, leaving the old house on Bell Street, and moving back into his mom’s house with his wife in a suburb of the city. It''s here where the songs of Bell House were born. Being back under the same roof he had grown up in where there was “still writing on the walls from childhood," Rausch found himself reflective and looking out at his life as a whole. <br><br>Take closing track “Champion” for instance, a song Collin says is dedicated to his and Kyle’s mother. “It’s just a note saying that she took care of us when we were young, and now it’s time for us to be there and take care of her.” <br><br>The reflective spirit sprinkled throughout the album is also evident on lead single, “Take The Doggie,” a bouncy, guitar driven track centered around wanting to secretly rescue their neighbor’s dog from an abusive owner, or on album highlight “Evil Sin,” which tackles the memory of drummer/bassist Konnor Ervin getting robbed. <br><br>But through all of this, Rausch kept his passion in his band, if even for nothing more than to - in his own words - have an excuse to keep hanging out with his brother and best friends. <br><br>“I have to keep Shy Boys alive to have a regular excuse to hang out with them,” says Collin. “To keep the band alive, I have to write songs. To be able to travel with my buddies, there has to be a new record.” <br><br>There is an old term that''s kicked around in country music called a "blood harmony" - in which two people in the same blood line, usually siblings, harmonize with one another in real time. Perhaps that is Shy Boys’ magic touch, putting them just a notch above all the other angels out there in the indie rock choir, and it makes sense, though no longer practicing evangelicals, Collin and Kyle grew up singing besides their parents in their church choir, so their keen sense of harmony is nothing new to them, but instead a life practice devoted to the voice as an instrument. <br><br>The result is Bell House, and the result is beautiful. There is something sensitive to the touch about this album, which is perhaps another way of saying that, well - Shy Boys are indeed Shy Boys. I envision the band as a solid unit, with each moving part as an equal. There is a heavy sense of family in everything they do both, literally and figuratively. Bruce Springsteen''s 1980 song “Highway Patrolman” always seems to come to mind; <br><br>"Yeah me and Franky out laughing and drinking, <br>Nothing feels better than blood on blood." <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Polyvinyl Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks)', '22:23', '53.7 / 136 / 247 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/3nyji7ju6uir/Shy_Boys_-_Bell_House_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-15 20:19:51.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-15 17:19:51', '2018-08-15 17:19:51'),

Ronnie Davis was born in Savannah La Mar in Jamaica''s Westmorland Parish in July of 1950. He began his professional career as a musician in 1967 when he was recruited to join The Tennors, a vocal group who had already scored a big hit with "Pressure And The Slide" on Coxsone''s Studio One label. The group scored another massive hit in 1968 with "Ride Your Donkey" with more hits following in 1973 when Ronnie led the group on "Weather Report" for Duke Reid''s Treasure Isle label and "Take Heed" for Bunny Lee. Both records sold well, and with encouragement from Bunny Lee, Ronnie left the group to pursue a solo career. During the mid-''70s Ronnie was among the most prolific of Jamaica''s vocalists, recording over 100 titles for a variety of labels and producers including a large body of work for Bunny Lee. By the late ''70s Davis was producing his own work for release on his own On Top label while continuing to work for other producers. He bonded with producer Lloyd Campbell who released some of Davis'' best work on the Spider Man label and included "Won''t You Come Home" which became a minor hit due in part to the superb rhythm track from The Revolutionaires. Ronnie loved this record, and soon returned to Lloyd Campbell with Keith Porter, a friend from Savannah La Mar who had written a new song for the rhythm. Together they cut "In A Dis A Time" with Keith leading the fierce Rastafarian classic with sweet harmony from Ronnie. The song, credited to The Itals, became a massive local hit. They added a third singer, Lloyd Ricketts, and Campbell and continued recording.

It’s partly a farewell to Wales, and hello to Scotland.”<br><br>The record was largely built in South Wales, a three-year process that saw the band retreat to their basement for endless sonic incisions and revisions. A broader, wider, perhaps bolder experience than their debut, ‘All Good Wishes’ is rooted in fantastic pop songwriting, in creating three minute vignettes that express complex ideas in a simple, accessible, endlessly fascinating way. Endlessly restrained yet infinitely open, each Gulp track is like a world in miniature, ideas borrowed from Krautrock and electronic culture slimmed down into these infinitely enjoyable pop songs.<br><br>Minimalist Kraut-pop with a dreamy, Cocteau Twins esque vibe, recent single ‘Morning Velvet Sky’ was a potent introduction to the duo’s ever-shifting realm.

Rollin'' With the Flow', '<!--QuoteEBegin-->Four years after releasing their Merge debut, Frozen Letter, Spider Bags have returned with Someday Everything Will Be Fine, an LP that ascends to new levels of aural punch and perspective. The years that elapsed between records were crucial in enabling that progress to take place. “We had gone as far as we could go with touring all the time, and cranking out singles and our own records,” says frontman Dan McGee, reflecting on the prolific touring and recording pace he and his bandmates have kept up since 2007. “I really wanted to see what would happen if we were just concentrating on material instead of preparing for shows. We were really able to focus on maybe 12, 14 songs—knowing we were going to have to bring them down to 10—and I think it’s a better record for it. We rehearsed ‘My Heart Is a Flame in Reverse’ and ‘Reckless’ for a year before we recorded them. That’s not something we’ve ever had the time to do before.” Recorded in Memphis at Bunker Audio by Andrew McCalla (who also engineered Spider Bags’ seminal 2012 rock and roll party record Shake my Head), Someday Everything Will Be Fine leverages the limitations and glory of the Tascam 388, a vintage recording/mixing device that’s acquired a mythos via its association with legendary records by Dinosaur Jr., East River Pipe, the Black Keys, Ty Segall, and Thee Oh Sees to name a few. The Tascam’s charms are more immediate, with a visceral resonance all its own. “It’s an 8-track machine designed for smaller studios, so your eight tracks are on quarter-inch tape. It squashes the tracks so close together they bleed into each other, which, you know, shouldn’t work, but it does. There’s also a certain compression that happens on those machines that cannot be duplicated. It feels live, but it also sounds like it took place in a studio. It’s not about being an analog purist—it’s about finding the medium that works best for what you’re trying to create, and the band has never sounded better than we sound on this record. I wanted to do as much as we could live, the four of us together playing the guitar solos and tripping effects on the fly like we would at a show. I wanted to capture the performance without the use of infinite tracks and the ability to click away mistakes. You have to be well rehearsed to make a record that way. The album is almost entirely first takes. ‘Burning Sand’ is not only a first take but also the first time we played the song all the way through, with a minute-long instrumental opening that was completely off the cuff. That’s how my favorite rock and roll records were made. It’s the limitations, I think, that create the performance.” Recording in Memphis also lent its own mojo to the album’s sound and feel. According to McGee, “Rock and roll just sounds better there. I swear.” Adding to this sound is the featured playing of Memphis giants Jack Oblivian, John Whittemore, Jana Misener and Krista Wroten-Combest of the Memphis Dawls, and multi-instrumentalist Seth Moody. “It’s a great town with so much individuality and history, musical and otherwise, that can’t help but seep into the music you’re making. I love that city.” Other non-Spider Bag contributing musicians include Patrick Stickles of Titus Andronicus and Matthew Hoopengardner of Austin, Texas, rock and roll legends the Golden Boys. The LP opens with “Reckless,” a strangely organic-sounding sprawl wrought from different parts of songs that McGee had struggled to complete, which peaks with gorgeous guitar fireworks. “The song didn’t seem satisfied until I brought in a couple pieces from other songs I hadn’t finished,” says McGee. “Steve [Oliva, the band’s bassist] said when we finished recording it, ‘There’s seven parts in that song and none of them repeat.’” From that epic build-up, the record returns to earth with the sprightly “Oxcart Blues,” whose twinned guitars a...<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Merge Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-48kHz FLAC (tracks)', '38:27', '105 / 239 / 449 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/j9srnvv9hwu5/Someday_Everything_Will_Be_Fine_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-15 20:21:13.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-15 17:21:14', '2018-08-15 17:21:14'),

To me, that roughly means "the stuff from which stuff generates." It''s a short hand way of evoking all the elements that I''m mashing up in this music. The idea is basically that it''s this collision of genres, and collision of different versions of "American music." It''s also an album that doesn''t fit very neatly into a category of album — studio? live? remix? Maybe all, or none, of the above. This is a new mutant variety of Elephant Micah, better suited to survive the cultural climate of the moment in so-called "Trump''s America." It lives! I guess the lodestone in the process of making this was the kind of global avant garde mood that''s prevalent in a lot of 1980s albums I admire. Things like Joni Mitchell''s Dog Eat Dog and Arthur Russell''s Calling Out of Context. These records where singers were making really eclectic and outward looking productions — writing *through* the process of recording, and literally *play- ing* with technologies that were totally new to them. All the gear that I gathered to make the album was basically discarded or devalued. I got a bunch of stuff from Craigslist that interested me: a cheap FM synth, some Hindustani electronics, and an old three-head tape deck to use as a "poor man''s space echo." The icing on the cake is a one-of-a-kind home- made digital synthesizer called "The Mutant". I worked with my brother to design it. He built it and coded it. The concept of the synth is parallel to the concept of the album itself. It''s an electronic take on "folk" sounds (bends, drones, modal playing) and folk creative approaches (a cobbling together and reformatting of existing elements).<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Western Vinyl', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks)', '32:07', '74.6 / 136 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/n1k81xrhxhpn/Elephant_Micah_-_Genericana_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-08-15 20:21:19.jpg', NULL, '2018-08-15 17:21:19', '2018-08-15 17:21:19'),

Their debut album Find Us Where We’re Hiding serves notice that the duo are ready to stride confidently into the public arena with a complete artistic vision that few emerging acts ever possess. Find Us Where We’re Hiding often has a decidedly elegiac, melancholy air, but much of the album is likewise full of the energy we rightly expect from a fresh act eager to demonstrate their talents for the biggest possible audience. Their album Find Us Where We’re Hiding weaves strands of electronic music, ambient sound, pop, and rock with even a dash of acoustic sounds into a signature formula that’s powerful and full of potential for the future.<br><br>They never go overboard with the ambient touches; the opener “Boy in the Hood” features some of that penchant for ambient adornments, but in a moderate and tasteful manner. “Girl’s Trip” and the later song “Orange Vox” bring us the closest things to traditional musical moments that we’ll encounter on Find Us Where We’re Hiding, but are nevertheless infused with the distinctive personality that makes the entirety of the album come popping out of the speakers. The latter tune generates a lot of gentle forward motion, never pushing against listeners too hard, but always inexorable and Julee Bee delivers a fine lyric with the cool, confident voice of someone born to sing in this style. “Heaven Looks Alright” is another of the album’s vocal numbers and soars skyward on the back of another exceptional singing performance from Bee. Her writing for the album is an excellent match for the musical imagination arranger Harry Starbuck brings to the release.<br><br>“Angel”, the album’s penultimate tune, obscures and distorts vocals more than any other cut on Find Us Where We’re Hiding and probably rates as the most challenging listen on the release. Coming when it does, on the doorstep of the album’s conclusion, is a brave and audacious move on the duo’s half, but it’s also a vote of confidence in their target audience’s ability to handle such a curve ball so late in the album. “One Trick Pony” serves up a final surprise for listeners thanks to its comparatively uncomplicated approach and the insistent percussion standing out from the mix and giving it much of its distinctive sound. Bee turns in a final vocal for Find Us Where We’re Hiding that’s every bit what this fine album deserves for a closer and her singing underscores a lot of the song’s percussive qualities while bringing melody to the table as well. Let’s hope that this new duo enjoys all the success possible with this release and that it’s the first entry in a discography that will one day be a touchstone for future musicians. PHOSPHENES exhibit the sort of potential from a modern art rock/electronica act that I haven’t heard in years.<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Fayz Records', NULL, '320 kbps | FLAC (tracks) | 24Bit/48 kHz FLAC', '00:45:20', '104 mb | 270 mb | 516 mb', 'https://fc.4crp.com/d/ighqhc', 0, NULL, NULL, '2018-05-25 08:38:09', '2018-07-01 13:39:40'),

Shaw''s death from a stroke three months after the sessions assured that this last recording would get extra attention, primarily viewed through a lens of reverence, respect, and retrospection. In the more ruthless world of commerce and criticism, however, the question will be how this recording stands up to the competition. The answer: This eloquent, cohesive, and confidently paced performance is sufficiently thoughtful and so clearly centered in its point of view that it will be the version of choice not only for Shaw''s legions, but also for anyone who prefers a chorus-dominant listening perspective and a dramatic interpretive attitude. Shaw''s soloists, too, are the most evenly matched on disc, although Telarc''s balance sometimes places them too far forward.<br>In comparison, Jiri Belohlavek''s excellent version for Chandos from 1991 opts for a choral sound that''s more blended into the orchestra and farther away. And although the Atlanta choir''s front and center role gives it impressive presence and authority, many listeners will prefer Belohlavek''s totally contrasting stance, in which the Prague Philharmonic Choir seems to be guided by a deeply felt understanding of the work''s inherent gentleness and tenderness. Thus, there is a soul-satisfying purity and lyricism to their lines that''s missing from Shaw''s more emphatic but equally assured direction. The Prague ensemble''s exquisite legato singing in the first movement is more effective than the more pronounced style of Shaw''s chorus in the same passages, and the Czech chorus produces softer consonants and vowels; the American sound is typically more hard and open. These technical considerations and interpretive mannerisms aside, you can''t go wrong with Shaw''s heartfelt, intense effort. Would that we all could leave the world with such a profoundly beautiful goodbye. -- David Vernier<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Telarc', NULL, 'FLAC (image+.cue,log,scans)', '125:49', '449 mb', 'https://fc.4crp.com/d/wMKPX', 0, NULL, NULL, '2018-05-25 08:38:11', '2018-07-01 16:27:11'),

Bach: Sei Solo a Violino senza Basso accompagnato', 'Hélène Schmitt', 'images/albums/album_image_2018-05-25 12:47:11.jpg', 2005, NULL, '<!--QuoteEBegin-->This wild recording, the first volume of two covering all the Bach sonatas and partitas for solo violin, may well polarize listeners into attitudes of love and hate. French violinist Hélène Schmitt delivers readings of the first sonata and the first two partitas that are nowhere near the mainstream for these celebrated works, which are generally regarded as icons of Bach''s intellectual accomplishment and have been subjected to all kinds of numerological analysis. Violinists have performed them on modern instruments and on Baroque violins like Schmitt''s, but whatever the instrument, the works have usually been accorded weighty, often severe reverence -- an attitude reinforced by their fearsome technical difficulty. Schmitt goes in the opposite direction, with rhythmically free, individualistic interpretations that demolish the symmetries many have found in these works but link them to the fantasy-like solo violin works written by Bach''s predecessors. Bach probably did not know the works of Biber, but those who enjoy that Austrian composer''s extreme language may well find Schmitt''s reading of interest. But despite her nationality there''s something decidedly un-French about Schmitt''s interpretations. Her treatments of the dance movements in the partitas are so idiosyncratic that the basic rhythms are lost. Sample track 8, the Sarabande movement of the Partita for solo violin No. 1, BWV 1002, to hear the distance between Schmitt''s sarabande and the dance''s stately origins. It''s almost as though, just as modern-instrument performers are starting to show the influence of historically oriented performers, Schmitt is using a Baroque violin to render a version of the hyper-subjective Bach performances of the old Romantic schools. The radical new French performances of Bach, Vivaldi, and other Baroque standards are generally exciting, and Alpha''s presentation is as compelling as usual; the Hans Holbein portrait on the cover, with its accompanying art-historical essay, offers a perfect visual analogue to Bach''s pieces in its sparse single lines that imply multitudes of structural details. Yet Schmitt''s performance, even as it certainly demands attention, is certainly not for everyone. <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Alpha', NULL, 'FLAC (image+.cue,log,scans)', '02:27:20', '1 Gb', 'https://fc.4crp.com/d/AGIQPb', 1, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-05-25 12:47:11.jpg', NULL, '2018-05-25 09:47:11', '2018-07-01 16:41:41'),

In 2002, through a good friend, Melendi''s three-song demo ended up in the hands of Carlito Records'' Javier Valiño, who enthusiastically signed him shortly thereafter. In February of 2003, Sin Noticias de Holanda was released, featuring 12 songs, all of them Melendi''s compositions. The disc''s release was followed by a short national tour, and by 2004 Melendi was appearing in the Top 100 on the national charts. The record went gold a short time later.<br><br>Melendi''s second disc, Que el Cielo Espere Sentao, was released in 2005, the same year that he celebrated the birth of his first daughter, Carlota. Melendi continued to tour, and his third album, entitled Mientras No Cueste Trabajo, was released in 2006. Two years later the Spanish pop crooner released his fourth record, Curiosa la Cara de Tu Padre (produced by fellow countryman José de Castro), which included the hit single "Un Violinista en Tu Tejado" Melendi returned in 2010 with his rock-oriented album Volvamos a Empezar and stepped away from his popular rhumba-inspired pop. This new approach continued with 2012''s Lágrimas Desordenadas and 2014''s critically acclaimed Un Alumno Más, the latter highly regarded as one of Melendi''s most honest, mature, and forthright pieces of work. In 2015, he released the live Directo a Septiembre and was awarded the Premio de la Música as well as several other awards from musical media stations Cadena Cien and 40 Principales. Melendi''s eighth studio album, Quitate las Gafas, was a personal effort that found the artist looking inside himself in his lyrics. Despite its introspective nature, the album became a popular success, rising to the top of the Spanish album charts. Yo Me Veo Contigo, Melendi''s ninth full-length effort, followed in 2017.<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Sony Music Entertainment España, S.L.', NULL, 'FLAC (tracks)', '47:31', '335 Mb', 'https://fc.4crp.com/d/rfZ5R', 0, NULL, NULL, '2018-05-25 09:47:21', '2018-07-01 17:02:06'),

The use of an almost disco-ish backing on "Sing a Happy Song" put him close to the sound coming out of Miami studios in the 1970s, though that''s not a form for which he was well suited. Mahal made a diverse record, true. There was a venture into something approaching straight soul on "Lowdown Showdown," and "The Most Recent (Evolution) of Muthafusticus Modernusticus," in addition to giving space for lengthy jazzy brass solos, was a pretty solid bid for the record title least likely to be announced in full by an FM DJ in 1978. For all his flirtations with Caribbean rhythms, the songs that put those in the background and let his blues and R&amp;B inclinations come to the fore were superior. He does quite a credible Howlin'' Wolf imitation on "The Big Blues," while "Southbound with the Hammer Down" is a pretty reasonable facsimile of Dr. John. Mahal would have been wiser to sound like himself, though, and by this time his best qualities seemed in danger of drowning in a Caribbean sunset.<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Warner Bros.

Released by Dinemec Classics in 1998, ''Carole Farley sings Grieg Songs'' follows Somm''s acclaimed recording of Grieg''s Piano Concerto and Piano Concerto No. 2 (arranged and orchestrated by Robert Matthew-Walker) by Mark Bebbington. Sensational American soprano Carole Farley brings enormous passion and exquisite poetry to intensely personal songs originally composed for piano accompaniment but here richly orchestrated by Jose Serebrier. Sung in Norwegian (with Norwegian texts and English translations in the booklet) the sublime result showcases Grieg at his most evocative, Farley at her most expressive and Serebrier at his most nuanced. Jose Serebrier says: ''My choice of songs for orchestration was dictated primarily by the character of the writing. In most cases, the orchestration seemed so obvious, it almost literally jumped out of the page. I took great care to orchestrate them idiomatically''. Carole Farley says: ''The idea for this recording was to make these under-performed songs available to a wider public. The poetry is so very evocative and the marriage of the words and the music makes these songs absolutely unique''.<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'SOMM Recordings', NULL, 'FLAC (tracks+booklet)', '01:03:42', '266 MB', 'https://fc.4crp.com/d/8xZST', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-22 14:10:08.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-22 11:10:08', '2018-07-02 04:43:53'),

Sung in Norwegian (with Norwegian texts and English translations in the booklet) the sublime result showcases Grieg at his most evocative, Farley at her most expressive and Serebrier at his most nuanced. Jose Serebrier says: ''My choice of songs for orchestration was dictated primarily by the character of the writing. In most cases, the orchestration seemed so obvious, it almost literally jumped out of the page. I took great care to orchestrate them idiomatically''. Carole Farley says: ''The idea for this recording was to make these under-performed songs available to a wider public.

Maghreb United has a range of excellent singers from Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia sitting at the centre of an ecstatic whirl of traditional instrumentation, distorted treatments, and big booming bass and drum patterns. Brilliant, energetic stuff, out on the Glitterbeat label. <br><br>On his debut release, Maghreb United, featuring the singers Mehdi Nassouli (Morocco), Sofiane Saidi (Algeria), and Cheb Hassen Tej (Tunisia), he connects the two to offer a radical, electronic reinvention of ancient North African music. AMMAR 808 started the project in 2017, after working with the lauded Bargou 08, searching for something to link the sense of what has been with what will be. "I''m trying to weave threads from folklore and mythology into futurism. And I''m not necessarily projecting a positive image; from all we can see, things aren''t going in the right direction. What I hope is that it will raise an alarm." Yet there''s also plenty of hope here. With singers from Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco, songs from the Targ, Gnawa, and Raï histories, and a TR-808 alongside a distorted gumbri (Nassouli), gasba flute, and zokra bagpipes (Lassaed Bougalmi), this is an album that reaches out to encompass the entire Maghreb area of North Africa. "In the past the Maghreb was one huge region, yet very diverse within its borders. But today, the world keeps every person separated. The album isn''t so much about a united Maghrebi region, but how we can connect while observing our differences -- our differences are also our connection -- and using them to unify as humans." The choice of songs was also very deliberate for AMMAR 808, with nine of the ten cuts taken from the deep tradition. The idea for Maghreb United (which is also the name for the album''s performing group) has long been burning in AMMAR 808, but it burst into flame after the musician and producer met all the singers on his regular trips in the region, before returning home to start building the tracks. The deep, rumbling growl of the gumbri, the dry, airy tenderness of the gasba, and the softly slithering zokra give a powerful North African root to the music, a thread that spins back through centuries. And the singers burn with fire and grace and passion. <br><br>AMMAR 808<br>Sofiane Saidi, vocals<br>Mehdi Nassouli, vocals<br>Cheb Hassen Tej, vocals <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Glitterbeat', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks+booklet)', '36:27', '85.5 / 219 / 405 MB', 'https://fc.4crp.com/d/y7vI8', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-22 14:21:05.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-22 11:21:06', '2018-07-02 06:12:17'),

It stands to reason that many vital albums come critically close to never being made. The eight-track upshot of doubt, upheaval and financial strain, Stains on Silence by Girls Names is one such release. Following 2015''s blitzing Arms Around a Vision, and the parting of drummer Gib Cassidy just over a year later, the Belfast band suddenly found themselves facing down a looming void. ''There was a finished and then aborted mix of the album, which was shelved for six months,'' reveals Girls Names frontman Cathal Cully. ''We then took a break from all music and went back to full-time work. We chilled out from the stress of rushing the record and not being happy with it, as well as being skint with no impending touring on the cards and constantly having to worry about rent.'' The stumbling blocks that proved a strain became the album''s defining breakthrough. Recorded in various locations including Belfast''s Start Together Studio with Ben McAuley, Cully''s home and the band''s practice space, spontaneous creation, cut-up techniques and self-editing took centre-stage for the first time. ''We started tearing the material apart and rebuilding, re-editing and re-recording different parts in my home in early Autumn last year,'' says Cully. ''When we got them to a place we were happier with we went back into Start Together Studio with Ben McAuley to finalise the mixes to what they are now.'' Where AAAV proved a brazen statement of intent, Stains on Silence bounds forth as its feature-length comedown. What could have seen the band buckle became an opportunity for approaching things tabula rasa. During its two-year transmutation, Cully, bassist Claire Miskimmin and guitarist Philip Quinn had a single aim for their fourth album: to make an old-fashioned record clocking in around 30 to 35 minutes in length that made the listener reach straight for repeat. From the Bang Bang bar-summoning swoon of opener 25 and the submerged disco doom of Haus Proud to the rapt, dub-leaning Fragments of a Portrait , Girls Names have excelled in their goal by forging an LP of synchronous nuance and defiance. Marked by the presence of drum machines and programming throughout, these eight masterfully-woven tales are once again commandeered by founder Cully, whose words, understated yet defiant, mine purpose and meaning from the mire ("I want to bathe again, I want to swim again / In a pool of twisting bodies, blackened gold." 25 ). But while Stains on Silence came critically close to never being made, having lived with it, reconfigured it, and guided its metamorphosis from flickers of inspiration and half-formed schemes, it''s both a statement of pure perseverance, and a head-on confrontation with ambivalence that couldn''t be more assured.

When Rolling Blackouts C.F. started, with Joe Russo [Tom’s brother] on bass, Marcel [Tussie, Joe White''s then-housemate] on drums, the chemistry was immediate. After a split EP with You Yangs (another Russo brother''s band), released in the form of a frisbee, they self-released Talk Tight in 2015, which Sydney-based record label Ivy League gave a wider release the following year. Talk Tight garnered plaudits from critics, including legendary rock scribe Robert Christgau. In 2017, Sub Pop released The French Press EP, bringing the band''s chugging and tuneful non-linear indie rock to the rest of the world as they settled into their sound with remarkable ease. <br><br>Hope Downs was largely written over the past year in the band''s Melbourne rehearsal room where their previous releases were also written and recorded. The band''s core trio of songwriters hunkered down and wrote as the chaos of the world outside unavoidably seeped into the songwriting process. "We were feeling like we were in a moment where the sands were shifting and the world was getting a lot weirder. There was a general sense that things were coming apart at the seams and people around us were too,” Russo explains. The album title, taken from the name of a vast open cut mine in the middle of Australia, refers to the feeling of “standing at the edge of the void of the big unknown, and finding something to hold on to.” <br><br>With the help of engineer/producer Liam Judson and his portable setup, the band recorded Hope Downs live, and co-produced ten guitar pop gems over the course of two weeks in Northern New South Wales during the winter of 2017. Hope Downs possesses a robust full-band sound that''s all the more impressive considering the band''s avoidance of traditional recording studios. If you loved Talk Tight and The French Press, you certainly won''t be disappointed here—but you might also be surprised at how the band’s sound has grown. There''s a richness and weight to these songs that was previously only hinted at, from the skyscraping chorus of “Sister''s Jeans” to the thrilling climax of album closer “The Hammer.” <br><br>Hope Downs is as much about the people that populate the world around us—their stories, perspectives, and hopes in the face of disillusionment—as it is about the state of things at large. It''s a record that focuses on finding the bright spots at a time when cynicism all too often feels like the natural state. Rolling Blackouts C.F. are here to remind us to keep our feet on the ground—and Hope Downs is as delicious a taste of terra firma as you''re going to get from a rock band right now. <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Sub Pop Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-48kHz FLAC (tracks)', '35:17', '83.8 / 244 / 447 MB', 'https://fc.4crp.com/d/95OU5b', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-22 14:21:33.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-22 11:21:33', '2018-07-02 06:28:57'),

The record features de-facto band leader Isaiah Barr on alto and tenor saxophone, Austin Williamson on drums, Walter Stinson on upright bass, Spencer Murphy on electric bass, and Roy Nathanson as guest saxophone on four tracks. A group of New York mainstays cross in and out of the Onyx universe and often performing live with the band, including Nick Hakim, Princess Nokia, Dev Hynes (Blood Orange), Wiki (Ratking), Julian Soto and Felix Pastorius. Onyx members quietly feature on a bevy of other artists’ records too, with Barr himself recently boasting 3 features on the new David Byrne album and making a cameo in Ibeyi’s live band for their performance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Whereas previous Onyx Collective projects capture New York City''s more romantic facets, Lower East Suite Part Three has a much more ominous sound, reflective of the dissonance that accompanies life in the city. After being forced out of their original practice space due to rising rent, Onyx Collective relocated their headquarters to Magic Gallery on Market St, located in a gritty pocket of Chinatown by the East River. “When I wrote the record I was thinking about concepts like eviction and gentrification,” explains Barr. “The record is born out of the challenges of being in New York.” <br><br>Recorded at Magic Gallery, Lower East Suite Part Three is the first release from Onyx Collective composed of entirely written music. “The record is a graduation for us - from not just having a microphone at a session and spontaneously recording,” says Barr. “This is us doing it on our own, with our own engineer, with a very low budget. That survival is really what I think jazz is: creating with your surroundings, and making something that''s a picture of that.” While the new music is more premeditated than the impromptu nature of their previous work, New York''s deafening influence remains present. “To some degree it''s controlled, but how much is it actually controlled?” continues Barr. “At the end of one of the songs you can still hear a siren from the street. Because we weren''t in a professional studio, it''s not a controlled environment. We''re still in New York.” <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Big Dada', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks)', '34:53', '83.5 / 214 MB', 'https://fc.4crp.com/d/FmPCI', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-22 14:27:07.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-22 11:27:07', '2018-07-02 06:31:11'),

Here he plays on a design of the French horn that would have been a standard for the 19th century and beyond. The singular sound of this instrument, as heard on this album, harkens back to some of the best virtuosic players of the golden age of the design. The repertoire of Planel, Tomasi, Bozza, Gounod, Dukas, Saint-Saens and others are presented as these composers intended and “heard” their works to be played on this French valved instrument. The technical competence required for each track is unique, as some of them were regarded as a test of the highest level of performance. The Saint-Saens and Gounod tracks are included as examples of the pure vocal treatment of the horn by two of France’s greatest composers. The Dukas track was the first conservatory test-piece for horn to specifically exploit the newly “legitimized” valve instrument. Tomasi describes what he composed in this way: “I write for the public at large. Music that doesn’t come from the heart isn’t music.” Listening to this album will give you a peek into a world of the French horn which has seldom been heard, and certainly not in one collection such as this, played by one of the instrument’s best and most studied masters.<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Affetto Recordings', NULL, 'FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-96kHz FLAC (tracks+booklet)', '60:49', '176 / 975 MB', 'https://fc.4crp.com/d/vBRG2', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-22 14:30:25.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-22 11:30:25', '2018-07-02 07:00:20'),

This series now sheds new light on a selection of Tarp’s orchestral works, opening chronologically with some suites, overtures, and two small concertos. These are early and charming works that show a development from the elegant and easily accessible towards a more clarified neoclassicist style, which later became one of Tarp’s hallmarks. This is the first of three albums in the set which will focus on Tarp’s orchestral music. The succeeding volumes will contain Tarp’s Symphonies 1-3 and his Piano Concerto. The series is chronologically built, illustrating Tarp’s development as a composer, starting with his elegant music, inspired by French impressionism.

Released by Dinemec Classics in 1998, ''Carole Farley sings Grieg Songs'' follows Somm''s acclaimed recording of Grieg''s Piano Concerto and Piano Concerto No. 2 (arranged and orchestrated by Robert Matthew-Walker) by Mark Bebbington. Sensational American soprano Carole Farley brings enormous passion and exquisite poetry to intensely personal songs originally composed for piano accompaniment but here richly orchestrated by Jose Serebrier. Sung in Norwegian (with Norwegian texts and English translations in the booklet) the sublime result showcases Grieg at his most evocative, Farley at her most expressive and Serebrier at his most nuanced. Jose Serebrier says: ''My choice of songs for orchestration was dictated primarily by the character of the writing. In most cases, the orchestration seemed so obvious, it almost literally jumped out of the page. I took great care to orchestrate them idiomatically''. Carole Farley says: ''The idea for this recording was to make these under-performed songs available to a wider public. The poetry is so very evocative and the marriage of the words and the music makes these songs absolutely unique''.<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'SOMM Recordings', NULL, 'FLAC (tracks+booklet)', '01:03:42', '266 MB', 'https://fc.4crp.com/d/VuzVab', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-22 14:51:39.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-22 11:51:39', '2018-07-02 07:26:09'),

Maghreb United has a range of excellent singers from Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia sitting at the centre of an ecstatic whirl of traditional instrumentation, distorted treatments, and big booming bass and drum patterns. Brilliant, energetic stuff, out on the Glitterbeat label. <br><br>On his debut release, Maghreb United, featuring the singers Mehdi Nassouli (Morocco), Sofiane Saidi (Algeria), and Cheb Hassen Tej (Tunisia), he connects the two to offer a radical, electronic reinvention of ancient North African music. AMMAR 808 started the project in 2017, after working with the lauded Bargou 08, searching for something to link the sense of what has been with what will be. "I''m trying to weave threads from folklore and mythology into futurism. And I''m not necessarily projecting a positive image; from all we can see, things aren''t going in the right direction. What I hope is that it will raise an alarm." Yet there''s also plenty of hope here. With singers from Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco, songs from the Targ, Gnawa, and Raï histories, and a TR-808 alongside a distorted gumbri (Nassouli), gasba flute, and zokra bagpipes (Lassaed Bougalmi), this is an album that reaches out to encompass the entire Maghreb area of North Africa. "In the past the Maghreb was one huge region, yet very diverse within its borders. But today, the world keeps every person separated. The album isn''t so much about a united Maghrebi region, but how we can connect while observing our differences -- our differences are also our connection -- and using them to unify as humans." The choice of songs was also very deliberate for AMMAR 808, with nine of the ten cuts taken from the deep tradition. The idea for Maghreb United (which is also the name for the album''s performing group) has long been burning in AMMAR 808, but it burst into flame after the musician and producer met all the singers on his regular trips in the region, before returning home to start building the tracks. The deep, rumbling growl of the gumbri, the dry, airy tenderness of the gasba, and the softly slithering zokra give a powerful North African root to the music, a thread that spins back through centuries. And the singers burn with fire and grace and passion. <br><br>AMMAR 808<br>Sofiane Saidi, vocals<br>Mehdi Nassouli, vocals<br>Cheb Hassen Tej, vocals <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Glitterbeat', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks+booklet)', '36:27', '85.5 / 219 / 405 MB', 'https://fc.4crp.com/d/tx7xjb', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-22 14:54:29.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-22 11:54:29', '2018-07-02 08:15:01'),

It stands to reason that many vital albums come critically close to never being made. The eight-track upshot of doubt, upheaval and financial strain, Stains on Silence by Girls Names is one such release. Following 2015''s blitzing Arms Around a Vision, and the parting of drummer Gib Cassidy just over a year later, the Belfast band suddenly found themselves facing down a looming void. ''There was a finished and then aborted mix of the album, which was shelved for six months,'' reveals Girls Names frontman Cathal Cully. ''We then took a break from all music and went back to full-time work. We chilled out from the stress of rushing the record and not being happy with it, as well as being skint with no impending touring on the cards and constantly having to worry about rent.'' The stumbling blocks that proved a strain became the album''s defining breakthrough. Recorded in various locations including Belfast''s Start Together Studio with Ben McAuley, Cully''s home and the band''s practice space, spontaneous creation, cut-up techniques and self-editing took centre-stage for the first time. ''We started tearing the material apart and rebuilding, re-editing and re-recording different parts in my home in early Autumn last year,'' says Cully. ''When we got them to a place we were happier with we went back into Start Together Studio with Ben McAuley to finalise the mixes to what they are now.'' Where AAAV proved a brazen statement of intent, Stains on Silence bounds forth as its feature-length comedown. What could have seen the band buckle became an opportunity for approaching things tabula rasa. During its two-year transmutation, Cully, bassist Claire Miskimmin and guitarist Philip Quinn had a single aim for their fourth album: to make an old-fashioned record clocking in around 30 to 35 minutes in length that made the listener reach straight for repeat. From the Bang Bang bar-summoning swoon of opener 25 and the submerged disco doom of Haus Proud to the rapt, dub-leaning Fragments of a Portrait , Girls Names have excelled in their goal by forging an LP of synchronous nuance and defiance. Marked by the presence of drum machines and programming throughout, these eight masterfully-woven tales are once again commandeered by founder Cully, whose words, understated yet defiant, mine purpose and meaning from the mire ("I want to bathe again, I want to swim again / In a pool of twisting bodies, blackened gold." 25 ). But while Stains on Silence came critically close to never being made, having lived with it, reconfigured it, and guided its metamorphosis from flickers of inspiration and half-formed schemes, it''s both a statement of pure perseverance, and a head-on confrontation with ambivalence that couldn''t be more assured.

The Hammer 04:29', '<!--QuoteEBegin-->It''s rare that a band''s debut album sounds as confident and self-assured as Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever''s Hope Downs. To say that the first full-length from the Melbourne quintet improves on their buzz-building EPs from the last few years would be an understatement: the promise those early releases hinted at is fully realized here, with ten songs of urgent, passionate guitar pop that elicit warm memories of bands past, from the Go-Betweens'' jangle to the charmingly lo-fi trappings of New Zealand''s Flying Nun label. But don''t mistake Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever for nostalgists: Hope Downs is the sound of a band finding its own collective voice. <br>The hard-hitting debut album is a testament to Rolling Blackouts C.F.’s tight-knit and hard-working bonafides. Prior to forming the band in 2013, singers/guitarists Fran Keaney, Tom Russo, and Joe White had played together in various garage bands, dating back to high school. When Rolling Blackouts C.F. started, with Joe Russo [Tom’s brother] on bass, Marcel [Tussie, Joe White''s then-housemate] on drums, the chemistry was immediate. After a split EP with You Yangs (another Russo brother''s band), released in the form of a frisbee, they self-released Talk Tight in 2015, which Sydney-based record label Ivy League gave a wider release the following year. Talk Tight garnered plaudits from critics, including legendary rock scribe Robert Christgau. In 2017, Sub Pop released The French Press EP, bringing the band''s chugging and tuneful non-linear indie rock to the rest of the world as they settled into their sound with remarkable ease. <br><br>Hope Downs was largely written over the past year in the band''s Melbourne rehearsal room where their previous releases were also written and recorded. The band''s core trio of songwriters hunkered down and wrote as the chaos of the world outside unavoidably seeped into the songwriting process. "We were feeling like we were in a moment where the sands were shifting and the world was getting a lot weirder. There was a general sense that things were coming apart at the seams and people around us were too,” Russo explains. The album title, taken from the name of a vast open cut mine in the middle of Australia, refers to the feeling of “standing at the edge of the void of the big unknown, and finding something to hold on to.” <br><br>With the help of engineer/producer Liam Judson and his portable setup, the band recorded Hope Downs live, and co-produced ten guitar pop gems over the course of two weeks in Northern New South Wales during the winter of 2017. Hope Downs possesses a robust full-band sound that''s all the more impressive considering the band''s avoidance of traditional recording studios. If you loved Talk Tight and The French Press, you certainly won''t be disappointed here—but you might also be surprised at how the band’s sound has grown. There''s a richness and weight to these songs that was previously only hinted at, from the skyscraping chorus of “Sister''s Jeans” to the thrilling climax of album closer “The Hammer.” <br><br>Hope Downs is as much about the people that populate the world around us—their stories, perspectives, and hopes in the face of disillusionment—as it is about the state of things at large. It''s a record that focuses on finding the bright spots at a time when cynicism all too often feels like the natural state. Rolling Blackouts C.F. are here to remind us to keep our feet on the ground—and Hope Downs is as delicious a taste of terra firma as you''re going to get from a rock band right now. <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Sub Pop Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-48kHz FLAC (tracks)', '35:17', '83.8 / 244 / 447 MB', 'https://fc.4crp.com/d/sdlpgc', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-22 14:54:57.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-22 11:54:57', '2018-07-02 08:48:38'),

Released by Dinemec Classics in 1998, ''Carole Farley sings Grieg Songs'' follows Somm''s acclaimed recording of Grieg''s Piano Concerto and Piano Concerto No. 2 (arranged and orchestrated by Robert Matthew-Walker) by Mark Bebbington. Sensational American soprano Carole Farley brings enormous passion and exquisite poetry to intensely personal songs originally composed for piano accompaniment but here richly orchestrated by Jose Serebrier. Sung in Norwegian (with Norwegian texts and English translations in the booklet) the sublime result showcases Grieg at his most evocative, Farley at her most expressive and Serebrier at his most nuanced. Jose Serebrier says: ''My choice of songs for orchestration was dictated primarily by the character of the writing. In most cases, the orchestration seemed so obvious, it almost literally jumped out of the page. I took great care to orchestrate them idiomatically''. Carole Farley says: ''The idea for this recording was to make these under-performed songs available to a wider public. The poetry is so very evocative and the marriage of the words and the music makes these songs absolutely unique''.<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'SOMM Recordings', NULL, 'FLAC (tracks+booklet)', '01:03:42', '266 MB', 'https://fc.4crp.com/d/O3cdlb', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-25 09:07:36.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-25 06:07:36', '2018-07-02 10:12:23'),

Maghreb United has a range of excellent singers from Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia sitting at the centre of an ecstatic whirl of traditional instrumentation, distorted treatments, and big booming bass and drum patterns. Brilliant, energetic stuff, out on the Glitterbeat label. <br><br>On his debut release, Maghreb United, featuring the singers Mehdi Nassouli (Morocco), Sofiane Saidi (Algeria), and Cheb Hassen Tej (Tunisia), he connects the two to offer a radical, electronic reinvention of ancient North African music. AMMAR 808 started the project in 2017, after working with the lauded Bargou 08, searching for something to link the sense of what has been with what will be. "I''m trying to weave threads from folklore and mythology into futurism. And I''m not necessarily projecting a positive image; from all we can see, things aren''t going in the right direction. What I hope is that it will raise an alarm." Yet there''s also plenty of hope here. With singers from Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco, songs from the Targ, Gnawa, and Raï histories, and a TR-808 alongside a distorted gumbri (Nassouli), gasba flute, and zokra bagpipes (Lassaed Bougalmi), this is an album that reaches out to encompass the entire Maghreb area of North Africa. "In the past the Maghreb was one huge region, yet very diverse within its borders. But today, the world keeps every person separated. The album isn''t so much about a united Maghrebi region, but how we can connect while observing our differences -- our differences are also our connection -- and using them to unify as humans." The choice of songs was also very deliberate for AMMAR 808, with nine of the ten cuts taken from the deep tradition. The idea for Maghreb United (which is also the name for the album''s performing group) has long been burning in AMMAR 808, but it burst into flame after the musician and producer met all the singers on his regular trips in the region, before returning home to start building the tracks. The deep, rumbling growl of the gumbri, the dry, airy tenderness of the gasba, and the softly slithering zokra give a powerful North African root to the music, a thread that spins back through centuries. And the singers burn with fire and grace and passion. <br><br>AMMAR 808<br>Sofiane Saidi, vocals<br>Mehdi Nassouli, vocals<br>Cheb Hassen Tej, vocals <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Glitterbeat', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks+booklet)', '36:27', '85.5 / 219 / 405 MB', 'https://fc.4crp.com/d/7E1Ldb', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-25 09:10:21.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-25 06:10:22', '2018-07-02 10:47:20'),

It stands to reason that many vital albums come critically close to never being made. The eight-track upshot of doubt, upheaval and financial strain, Stains on Silence by Girls Names is one such release. Following 2015''s blitzing Arms Around a Vision, and the parting of drummer Gib Cassidy just over a year later, the Belfast band suddenly found themselves facing down a looming void. ''There was a finished and then aborted mix of the album, which was shelved for six months,'' reveals Girls Names frontman Cathal Cully. ''We then took a break from all music and went back to full-time work. We chilled out from the stress of rushing the record and not being happy with it, as well as being skint with no impending touring on the cards and constantly having to worry about rent.'' The stumbling blocks that proved a strain became the album''s defining breakthrough. Recorded in various locations including Belfast''s Start Together Studio with Ben McAuley, Cully''s home and the band''s practice space, spontaneous creation, cut-up techniques and self-editing took centre-stage for the first time. ''We started tearing the material apart and rebuilding, re-editing and re-recording different parts in my home in early Autumn last year,'' says Cully. ''When we got them to a place we were happier with we went back into Start Together Studio with Ben McAuley to finalise the mixes to what they are now.'' Where AAAV proved a brazen statement of intent, Stains on Silence bounds forth as its feature-length comedown. What could have seen the band buckle became an opportunity for approaching things tabula rasa. During its two-year transmutation, Cully, bassist Claire Miskimmin and guitarist Philip Quinn had a single aim for their fourth album: to make an old-fashioned record clocking in around 30 to 35 minutes in length that made the listener reach straight for repeat. From the Bang Bang bar-summoning swoon of opener 25 and the submerged disco doom of Haus Proud to the rapt, dub-leaning Fragments of a Portrait , Girls Names have excelled in their goal by forging an LP of synchronous nuance and defiance. Marked by the presence of drum machines and programming throughout, these eight masterfully-woven tales are once again commandeered by founder Cully, whose words, understated yet defiant, mine purpose and meaning from the mire ("I want to bathe again, I want to swim again / In a pool of twisting bodies, blackened gold." 25 ). But while Stains on Silence came critically close to never being made, having lived with it, reconfigured it, and guided its metamorphosis from flickers of inspiration and half-formed schemes, it''s both a statement of pure perseverance, and a head-on confrontation with ambivalence that couldn''t be more assured.

The Hammer 04:29', '<!--QuoteEBegin-->It''s rare that a band''s debut album sounds as confident and self-assured as Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever''s Hope Downs. To say that the first full-length from the Melbourne quintet improves on their buzz-building EPs from the last few years would be an understatement: the promise those early releases hinted at is fully realized here, with ten songs of urgent, passionate guitar pop that elicit warm memories of bands past, from the Go-Betweens'' jangle to the charmingly lo-fi trappings of New Zealand''s Flying Nun label. But don''t mistake Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever for nostalgists: Hope Downs is the sound of a band finding its own collective voice. <br>The hard-hitting debut album is a testament to Rolling Blackouts C.F.’s tight-knit and hard-working bonafides. Prior to forming the band in 2013, singers/guitarists Fran Keaney, Tom Russo, and Joe White had played together in various garage bands, dating back to high school. When Rolling Blackouts C.F. started, with Joe Russo [Tom’s brother] on bass, Marcel [Tussie, Joe White''s then-housemate] on drums, the chemistry was immediate. After a split EP with You Yangs (another Russo brother''s band), released in the form of a frisbee, they self-released Talk Tight in 2015, which Sydney-based record label Ivy League gave a wider release the following year. Talk Tight garnered plaudits from critics, including legendary rock scribe Robert Christgau. In 2017, Sub Pop released The French Press EP, bringing the band''s chugging and tuneful non-linear indie rock to the rest of the world as they settled into their sound with remarkable ease. <br><br>Hope Downs was largely written over the past year in the band''s Melbourne rehearsal room where their previous releases were also written and recorded. The band''s core trio of songwriters hunkered down and wrote as the chaos of the world outside unavoidably seeped into the songwriting process. "We were feeling like we were in a moment where the sands were shifting and the world was getting a lot weirder. There was a general sense that things were coming apart at the seams and people around us were too,” Russo explains. The album title, taken from the name of a vast open cut mine in the middle of Australia, refers to the feeling of “standing at the edge of the void of the big unknown, and finding something to hold on to.” <br><br>With the help of engineer/producer Liam Judson and his portable setup, the band recorded Hope Downs live, and co-produced ten guitar pop gems over the course of two weeks in Northern New South Wales during the winter of 2017. Hope Downs possesses a robust full-band sound that''s all the more impressive considering the band''s avoidance of traditional recording studios. If you loved Talk Tight and The French Press, you certainly won''t be disappointed here—but you might also be surprised at how the band’s sound has grown. There''s a richness and weight to these songs that was previously only hinted at, from the skyscraping chorus of “Sister''s Jeans” to the thrilling climax of album closer “The Hammer.” <br><br>Hope Downs is as much about the people that populate the world around us—their stories, perspectives, and hopes in the face of disillusionment—as it is about the state of things at large. It''s a record that focuses on finding the bright spots at a time when cynicism all too often feels like the natural state. Rolling Blackouts C.F. are here to remind us to keep our feet on the ground—and Hope Downs is as delicious a taste of terra firma as you''re going to get from a rock band right now. <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Sub Pop Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-48kHz FLAC (tracks)', '35:17', '83.8 / 244 / 447 MB', 'https://fc.4crp.com/d/1BD2ac', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-25 09:10:49.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-25 06:10:50', '2018-07-02 10:59:55');

She can belt and she can tease; she can aim a note as directly as a missile or turn its trajectory into an aerobatic spiral of leaping, quivering, scalloping melismas. Her voice is not an instrument for making modest statements; it’s about peaks of self-affirmation, indescribable sensual pleasures, steely counterattacks and abysses of sorrow.<br><br>She unleashes all of them on “Liberation,” her eighth studio album and her first since “Lotus” in 2012. It’s a return to the pop fray after multiple seasons as a coach on “The Voice” that made sure viewers didn’t forget her vocal mastery. It’s an album of extreme ups and downs: wretched and ecstatic, calculating and abandoned, seesawing between angst and raunch. Heard as a whole — unlikely as that might be in 2018 — it’s an album that moves through trauma, lust, resistance, obsession and, finally, lasting love. Her extravagant vocal flourishes connect with sweeping emotion.<br><br>Top 10 pop — the realm where Ms. Aguilera has repeatedly proved herself since “Genie in a Bottle” in 1999 — doesn’t always reward big, natural voices as it once did, especially for singers who aren’t named Adele. Auto-Tune; hip-hop; and the nasal, narcotized, dispirited voices of SoundCloud rap compete with, and often out-stream, the kind of soulful vocal storytelling that would have had Ms. Aguilera flourishing in previous eras.

A group of New York mainstays cross in and out of the Onyx universe and often performing live with the band, including Nick Hakim, Princess Nokia, Dev Hynes (Blood Orange), Wiki (Ratking), Julian Soto and Felix Pastorius. Onyx members quietly feature on a bevy of other artists’ records too, with Barr himself recently boasting 3 features on the new David Byrne album and making a cameo in Ibeyi’s live band for their performance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Whereas previous Onyx Collective projects capture New York City''s more romantic facets, Lower East Suite Part Three has a much more ominous sound, reflective of the dissonance that accompanies life in the city. After being forced out of their original practice space due to rising rent, Onyx Collective relocated their headquarters to Magic Gallery on Market St, located in a gritty pocket of Chinatown by the East River. “When I wrote the record I was thinking about concepts like eviction and gentrification,” explains Barr. “The record is born out of the challenges of being in New York.” <br><br>Recorded at Magic Gallery, Lower East Suite Part Three is the first release from Onyx Collective composed of entirely written music. “The record is a graduation for us - from not just having a microphone at a session and spontaneously recording,” says Barr. “This is us doing it on our own, with our own engineer, with a very low budget. That survival is really what I think jazz is: creating with your surroundings, and making something that''s a picture of that.” While the new music is more premeditated than the impromptu nature of their previous work, New York''s deafening influence remains present. “To some degree it''s controlled, but how much is it actually controlled?” continues Barr. “At the end of one of the songs you can still hear a siren from the street. Because we weren''t in a professional studio, it''s not a controlled environment. We''re still in New York.” <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Big Dada', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks)', '34:53', '83.5 / 214 MB', 'https://fc.4crp.com/d/mZNgw', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-25 09:16:26.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-25 06:16:26', '2018-07-02 11:04:23'),

"Since word first spread in the 1980s about the discovery of these 1967 recordings on a rare acetate in Liberty Records’ vaults, fans have come to regard Gene Clark Sings for You as nothing less than the Holy Grail of the singer-songwriter’s extraordinary body of work.

The album is available for pre-order today on vinyl, CD or download, along with the new single “Colors In The Dark” which can be streamed or downloaded now. The band’s DNA is evident in the song’s woozy soul with Martin''s robo-coo floating like a hallucination over a lush scene rooted by Hodge’s warm bass and featuring a breezy Glasper piano solo that crests in a sudden burst from Tyson. <br><br>Okayplayer wrote that “R+R=NOW consists of some of the brightest and baddest musicians in the game today,” adding that the album’s first single “Change Of Tone” “finds R+R=NOW fluidly showcasing their individual sounds as a cohesive blend… expressing hope, love, confidence, and resiliency through their respective melodies.” Stereogum declared the song “a powerful introduction to the band, highlighting each members’ skill and spirit,” while Paste called it “a hybrid encompassing all of black music—hip-hop, R&amp;B, jazz, soul, funk—with its layered instrumental laying out black excellence.” <br><br>In an era when every headline carries some new horror or fresh worry, we need music that can clap back with immediacy, skill, and heart. We need a band so at home in its skin that it can play without ego and lead with love—artists whose very existence attests to resilience and hope. We need R+R=NOW, a supergroup assembled by Glasper but functionally egalitarian, in no small part because its members are visionary players, composers, and producers on their own. This genre-mashing outfit moves as one and, as their name reveals, with great purpose. <br><br>“R+R stands for ‘Reflect’ and ‘Respond’,” says Glasper. The idea came to him via Nina Simone while he was coproducing Nina Revisited, a companion album to the 2015 film What Happened, Miss Simone? Facing backlash for her politics, Simone was asked, more or less, why she didn''t just shut up and sing. Her answer: “an artist’s duty, as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times.” Glasper adds: “When you reflect what''s going on in your time and respond to that, you can''t not be relevant. So ‘R’ plus ‘R’ equals ‘NOW’.” <br><br>In that spirit, Collagically Speaking isn''t some wonky thesis on the state of the nation. It’s a raw document that seamlessly adheres neo-soul to future-funk, West Coast jazz of the moment to astral electronica, instrumental hip-hop to musique concrète, avant-garde to classical—these are single-take songs, written live in the room, that go wherever this formidable crew''s mood goes. Guest voices get caught in that mix as well: actors Omari Hardwick (Power) and Terry Crews (Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Expendables); actress Amanda Seales (Insecure); MCs Stalley and yasiin bey (f.k.a. Mos Def); and singers Amber Navran (of Moonchild) and Goapele. The themes that bind it all together are both spoken and inferred: romantic love, universal love, systemic bigotry, the women''s movement, quiet power, wild creativity, personal loss and growth. <br><br>“Everyone in this band is a six-foot-tall black guy who didn''t come from an affluent background,” says Scott. “In order for us all to make it into that room together, we''ve had to go through some hell, fight for some things, build up a lot of armor, and do a lot ourselves to forge our realities, to become who we are.

The First Star', '<!--QuoteEBegin-->John Parish’s list of musical accomplishments is long, yet for years the self-effacing Bristol native has been happy outside the spotlight. This twice Ensor nominated composer and Mercury Prize winning producer delivers a collection of songs, including a duet with his longtime musical partner PJ Harvey, that should change all that. Bird Dog Dante was completed in a busy year for Parish. On top of being the musical director of the extended PJ Harvey band on their Hope Six Demolition Project world tour, he produced acclaimed albums for This is the Kit, Nadine Khouri, and Aldous Harding. <br><br>Parish records songs as they come to him, often with the intent of just capturing the idea. “Like all of my records, Bird Dog Dante was recorded all over the place in odd situations, because I’ll have an idea somewhere and want to record it, then I actually end up liking the sound of that specific recording and want to incorporate it,” says Parish. While a few of the tracks began with the band in Toybox in Bristol, often they were then deconstructed in Parish’s home studio. John’s producer’s ear can focus on a small detail that captures his imagination, which then becomes the foundation to build the song around. On “Rachel,” “Aldous Harding’s beautiful backing vocals were recorded on my phone backstage at her Jools Holland show. I’d been asked to play piano for her, and while we had time to kill in the dressing room before the performance I thought ‘let’s just do the backing vocals now’ – so while listening to the track on my iPhone, she sang into her iPhone. Those vocals were literally recorded with two phones and a pair of earbuds.“ John’s ability to see things for what they are and delight in the details is what makes his work so singular. Exemplified by the album title’s origin, words that just sounded good together, John is an exceptionally skilled artist with a youthful delight and a creative open mind, as well as the ability to masterfully expand on those ideas. It is clear why Uncut said that “Parish is one of Britain’s most resourceful and imaginative studio craftsmen.” <br><br>John’s recent solo records were instrumental, and mostly included works composed for film. While Bird Dog Dante contains a few pieces written for film, it is his first song oriented album in nearly a decade. Working while touring allowed him to bounce lyrics off his long time musical partner PJ Harvey. On “Sorry for Your Loss,” a song about their close friend Mark Linkous, it seemed only fitting to take it further and sing the song as a duet. With his eclectic recording locations and process, Parish brought cohesion to the album by mixing it in a 10 day stretch between bouts of touring. The music is gentle and quiet, not unlike its creator, and its heft comes through its emotional depth and its subtle delights from unexpected sound choices and processing. <br><br>John Parish is very much a family man, so it is fitting that the album became a family affair with artwork created by his daughter Honor and the layout designed by his wife Michelle Henning, who as well as being Professor of Photography at University of West London, was art director for PJ Harvey’s The Hope Six Demolition Project and also responsible for the iconic Let England Shake cover design. In addition to touring with this own band in April, John Parish is playing a commemorative show of Nick Drake’s music at St George’s, Bristol in what would have been Drake’s 70th year. <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Thrill Jockey', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks)', '34:47', '79.8 / 171 MB', 'https://fc.4crp.com/d/JNdA2b', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-25 09:17:16.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-25 06:17:16', '2018-07-02 11:35:13'),

Here he plays on a design of the French horn that would have been a standard for the 19th century and beyond. The singular sound of this instrument, as heard on this album, harkens back to some of the best virtuosic players of the golden age of the design. The repertoire of Planel, Tomasi, Bozza, Gounod, Dukas, Saint-Saens and others are presented as these composers intended and “heard” their works to be played on this French valved instrument. The technical competence required for each track is unique, as some of them were regarded as a test of the highest level of performance. The Saint-Saens and Gounod tracks are included as examples of the pure vocal treatment of the horn by two of France’s greatest composers. The Dukas track was the first conservatory test-piece for horn to specifically exploit the newly “legitimized” valve instrument. Tomasi describes what he composed in this way: “I write for the public at large. Music that doesn’t come from the heart isn’t music.” Listening to this album will give you a peek into a world of the French horn which has seldom been heard, and certainly not in one collection such as this, played by one of the instrument’s best and most studied masters.<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Affetto Recordings', NULL, 'FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-96kHz FLAC (tracks+booklet)', '60:49', '176 / 975 MB', 'https://fc.4crp.com/d/IWMGNb', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-25 09:19:52.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-25 06:19:52', '2018-07-02 11:48:09'),

This series now sheds new light on a selection of Tarp’s orchestral works, opening chronologically with some suites, overtures, and two small concertos. These are early and charming works that show a development from the elegant and easily accessible towards a more clarified neoclassicist style, which later became one of Tarp’s hallmarks. This is the first of three albums in the set which will focus on Tarp’s orchestral music. The succeeding volumes will contain Tarp’s Symphonies 1-3 and his Piano Concerto. The series is chronologically built, illustrating Tarp’s development as a composer, starting with his elegant music, inspired by French impressionism.

Miles Davis grew up in St. Louis where he heard such St. Louis trumpeters as Clark Terry, Irving Randolph and Shorty Baker when he was a boy, so Miles followed the “St. Louis trumpet tradition”. In the state of Texas it is tenor players, most of who seem to have grown up with big sounds and plenty of confidence, men such as Illinois Jacquet, Arnett Cobb, Jimmy Giuffre and King Curtis. But the Texas tenor is George Holmes “Buddy” Tate, born in Sherman, Texas on February 22, 1914, and now a much travelled and highly respected soloist whose very presence in a club is a guarantee of capacity crowds and a feeling of well-being. When long-service medals are distributed for work with big bands then Buddy must be considered for he was with Count Basie for six months in 1934 then, from the spring of 1939, he was in the Basie saxophone section for more than ten years. He took Herschal Evans’ place and sat alongside a succession of tenor playing colleagues including Lester Young, Paul Bascombe, Don Byas, Lucky Thompson, Illinois Jacquet and Paul Gonsalves. With such grounding it is hardly surprising that Buddy is every inch a professional or that his solo playing is strongly affected by the blues. He has an acute understanding of what an audience wants, which probably accounts for the fact that he took a seven-piece band into Harlem’s “Celebrity Club” in 1952 and was still pleasing the crowd there nearly 20 years later. In 1959 he made his first trip to Europe, as a member of Buck Clayton’s band, and since then he has been back almost every year. In 1970 he brought the complete “Celebrity Club” band over for a European tour but most often Buddy works on this side of the Atlantic as a soloist with local musicians. He tries not to be typecast in terms of material. I heard him open the first set at London’s “Seven Dials” jazz club one night at the end of 1974 with On Green Dolphin Street which must have surprised a number of people in the capacity audience. Similarly he looks forward to playing with supporting musicians of widely varied backgrounds, men who will stimulate his musical imagination rather than a rhythm section which tries to give him a pseudo-Bassie setting.<br><br>Bass – Bo Stief<br>Drums – Svend-Erik Nørregaard<br>Liner Notes – Alfredo Papo<br>Piano – Tete Montoliu<br>Tenor Saxophone – Buddy Tate<br>Violin – Finn Ziegler (tracks: 2,3)<br>Vocals – Buddy Tate (tracks: 3)<!--QuoteEnd-->', '2xHD', NULL, '24bit-192kHz FLAC (tracks+booklet)', '44:52', '1.58 GB', 'https://fc.4crp.com/d/X67jnc', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-25 09:25:56.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-25 06:25:57', '2018-07-03 04:47:15'),

Sung in Norwegian (with Norwegian texts and English translations in the booklet) the sublime result showcases Grieg at his most evocative, Farley at her most expressive and Serebrier at his most nuanced. Jose Serebrier says: ''My choice of songs for orchestration was dictated primarily by the character of the writing. In most cases, the orchestration seemed so obvious, it almost literally jumped out of the page. I took great care to orchestrate them idiomatically''. Carole Farley says: ''The idea for this recording was to make these under-performed songs available to a wider public.

Maghreb United has a range of excellent singers from Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia sitting at the centre of an ecstatic whirl of traditional instrumentation, distorted treatments, and big booming bass and drum patterns. Brilliant, energetic stuff, out on the Glitterbeat label. <br><br>On his debut release, Maghreb United, featuring the singers Mehdi Nassouli (Morocco), Sofiane Saidi (Algeria), and Cheb Hassen Tej (Tunisia), he connects the two to offer a radical, electronic reinvention of ancient North African music. AMMAR 808 started the project in 2017, after working with the lauded Bargou 08, searching for something to link the sense of what has been with what will be. "I''m trying to weave threads from folklore and mythology into futurism. And I''m not necessarily projecting a positive image; from all we can see, things aren''t going in the right direction. What I hope is that it will raise an alarm." Yet there''s also plenty of hope here. With singers from Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco, songs from the Targ, Gnawa, and Raï histories, and a TR-808 alongside a distorted gumbri (Nassouli), gasba flute, and zokra bagpipes (Lassaed Bougalmi), this is an album that reaches out to encompass the entire Maghreb area of North Africa. "In the past the Maghreb was one huge region, yet very diverse within its borders. But today, the world keeps every person separated. The album isn''t so much about a united Maghrebi region, but how we can connect while observing our differences -- our differences are also our connection -- and using them to unify as humans." The choice of songs was also very deliberate for AMMAR 808, with nine of the ten cuts taken from the deep tradition. The idea for Maghreb United (which is also the name for the album''s performing group) has long been burning in AMMAR 808, but it burst into flame after the musician and producer met all the singers on his regular trips in the region, before returning home to start building the tracks. The deep, rumbling growl of the gumbri, the dry, airy tenderness of the gasba, and the softly slithering zokra give a powerful North African root to the music, a thread that spins back through centuries. And the singers burn with fire and grace and passion. <br><br>AMMAR 808<br>Sofiane Saidi, vocals<br>Mehdi Nassouli, vocals<br>Cheb Hassen Tej, vocals <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Glitterbeat', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks+booklet)', '36:27', '85.5 / 219 / 405 MB', 'https://fc.4crp.com/d/qJ6a9', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-25 11:02:31.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-25 08:02:31', '2018-07-03 05:55:34'),

It stands to reason that many vital albums come critically close to never being made. The eight-track upshot of doubt, upheaval and financial strain, Stains on Silence by Girls Names is one such release. Following 2015''s blitzing Arms Around a Vision, and the parting of drummer Gib Cassidy just over a year later, the Belfast band suddenly found themselves facing down a looming void. ''There was a finished and then aborted mix of the album, which was shelved for six months,'' reveals Girls Names frontman Cathal Cully. ''We then took a break from all music and went back to full-time work. We chilled out from the stress of rushing the record and not being happy with it, as well as being skint with no impending touring on the cards and constantly having to worry about rent.'' The stumbling blocks that proved a strain became the album''s defining breakthrough. Recorded in various locations including Belfast''s Start Together Studio with Ben McAuley, Cully''s home and the band''s practice space, spontaneous creation, cut-up techniques and self-editing took centre-stage for the first time. ''We started tearing the material apart and rebuilding, re-editing and re-recording different parts in my home in early Autumn last year,'' says Cully. ''When we got them to a place we were happier with we went back into Start Together Studio with Ben McAuley to finalise the mixes to what they are now.'' Where AAAV proved a brazen statement of intent, Stains on Silence bounds forth as its feature-length comedown. What could have seen the band buckle became an opportunity for approaching things tabula rasa. During its two-year transmutation, Cully, bassist Claire Miskimmin and guitarist Philip Quinn had a single aim for their fourth album: to make an old-fashioned record clocking in around 30 to 35 minutes in length that made the listener reach straight for repeat. From the Bang Bang bar-summoning swoon of opener 25 and the submerged disco doom of Haus Proud to the rapt, dub-leaning Fragments of a Portrait , Girls Names have excelled in their goal by forging an LP of synchronous nuance and defiance. Marked by the presence of drum machines and programming throughout, these eight masterfully-woven tales are once again commandeered by founder Cully, whose words, understated yet defiant, mine purpose and meaning from the mire ("I want to bathe again, I want to swim again / In a pool of twisting bodies, blackened gold." 25 ). But while Stains on Silence came critically close to never being made, having lived with it, reconfigured it, and guided its metamorphosis from flickers of inspiration and half-formed schemes, it''s both a statement of pure perseverance, and a head-on confrontation with ambivalence that couldn''t be more assured.

The Hammer 04:29', '<!--QuoteEBegin-->It''s rare that a band''s debut album sounds as confident and self-assured as Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever''s Hope Downs. To say that the first full-length from the Melbourne quintet improves on their buzz-building EPs from the last few years would be an understatement: the promise those early releases hinted at is fully realized here, with ten songs of urgent, passionate guitar pop that elicit warm memories of bands past, from the Go-Betweens'' jangle to the charmingly lo-fi trappings of New Zealand''s Flying Nun label. But don''t mistake Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever for nostalgists: Hope Downs is the sound of a band finding its own collective voice. <br>The hard-hitting debut album is a testament to Rolling Blackouts C.F.’s tight-knit and hard-working bonafides. Prior to forming the band in 2013, singers/guitarists Fran Keaney, Tom Russo, and Joe White had played together in various garage bands, dating back to high school. When Rolling Blackouts C.F. started, with Joe Russo [Tom’s brother] on bass, Marcel [Tussie, Joe White''s then-housemate] on drums, the chemistry was immediate. After a split EP with You Yangs (another Russo brother''s band), released in the form of a frisbee, they self-released Talk Tight in 2015, which Sydney-based record label Ivy League gave a wider release the following year. Talk Tight garnered plaudits from critics, including legendary rock scribe Robert Christgau. In 2017, Sub Pop released The French Press EP, bringing the band''s chugging and tuneful non-linear indie rock to the rest of the world as they settled into their sound with remarkable ease. <br><br>Hope Downs was largely written over the past year in the band''s Melbourne rehearsal room where their previous releases were also written and recorded. The band''s core trio of songwriters hunkered down and wrote as the chaos of the world outside unavoidably seeped into the songwriting process. "We were feeling like we were in a moment where the sands were shifting and the world was getting a lot weirder. There was a general sense that things were coming apart at the seams and people around us were too,” Russo explains. The album title, taken from the name of a vast open cut mine in the middle of Australia, refers to the feeling of “standing at the edge of the void of the big unknown, and finding something to hold on to.” <br><br>With the help of engineer/producer Liam Judson and his portable setup, the band recorded Hope Downs live, and co-produced ten guitar pop gems over the course of two weeks in Northern New South Wales during the winter of 2017. Hope Downs possesses a robust full-band sound that''s all the more impressive considering the band''s avoidance of traditional recording studios. If you loved Talk Tight and The French Press, you certainly won''t be disappointed here—but you might also be surprised at how the band’s sound has grown. There''s a richness and weight to these songs that was previously only hinted at, from the skyscraping chorus of “Sister''s Jeans” to the thrilling climax of album closer “The Hammer.” <br><br>Hope Downs is as much about the people that populate the world around us—their stories, perspectives, and hopes in the face of disillusionment—as it is about the state of things at large. It''s a record that focuses on finding the bright spots at a time when cynicism all too often feels like the natural state. Rolling Blackouts C.F. are here to remind us to keep our feet on the ground—and Hope Downs is as delicious a taste of terra firma as you''re going to get from a rock band right now. <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Sub Pop Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-48kHz FLAC (tracks)', '35:17', '83.8 / 244 / 447 MB', 'https://fc.4crp.com/d/aWx35b', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-25 11:02:59.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-25 08:02:59', '2018-07-03 06:34:13'),

She can belt and she can tease; she can aim a note as directly as a missile or turn its trajectory into an aerobatic spiral of leaping, quivering, scalloping melismas. Her voice is not an instrument for making modest statements; it’s about peaks of self-affirmation, indescribable sensual pleasures, steely counterattacks and abysses of sorrow.<br><br>She unleashes all of them on “Liberation,” her eighth studio album and her first since “Lotus” in 2012. It’s a return to the pop fray after multiple seasons as a coach on “The Voice” that made sure viewers didn’t forget her vocal mastery. It’s an album of extreme ups and downs: wretched and ecstatic, calculating and abandoned, seesawing between angst and raunch. Heard as a whole — unlikely as that might be in 2018 — it’s an album that moves through trauma, lust, resistance, obsession and, finally, lasting love. Her extravagant vocal flourishes connect with sweeping emotion.<br><br>Top 10 pop — the realm where Ms. Aguilera has repeatedly proved herself since “Genie in a Bottle” in 1999 — doesn’t always reward big, natural voices as it once did, especially for singers who aren’t named Adele. Auto-Tune; hip-hop; and the nasal, narcotized, dispirited voices of SoundCloud rap compete with, and often out-stream, the kind of soulful vocal storytelling that would have had Ms. Aguilera flourishing in previous eras. A voice like hers has become something like a turntable: a vintage prize, a modern novelty, a niche taste.

At the more robust spectrum of the album with its rousing horn section is ''Warrior'' which is lyrically a spirited show of confidence from one friend to another, whilst on the gentler end of the record comes the tender romanticism of ''Quiet Man'', picked as the album''s title track as the song emerged from what Roo describes as "a place of stillness, peace and contentment".

Released by Dinemec Classics in 1998, ''Carole Farley sings Grieg Songs'' follows Somm''s acclaimed recording of Grieg''s Piano Concerto and Piano Concerto No. 2 (arranged and orchestrated by Robert Matthew-Walker) by Mark Bebbington. Sensational American soprano Carole Farley brings enormous passion and exquisite poetry to intensely personal songs originally composed for piano accompaniment but here richly orchestrated by Jose Serebrier. Sung in Norwegian (with Norwegian texts and English translations in the booklet) the sublime result showcases Grieg at his most evocative, Farley at her most expressive and Serebrier at his most nuanced. Jose Serebrier says: ''My choice of songs for orchestration was dictated primarily by the character of the writing. In most cases, the orchestration seemed so obvious, it almost literally jumped out of the page. I took great care to orchestrate them idiomatically''. Carole Farley says: ''The idea for this recording was to make these under-performed songs available to a wider public. The poetry is so very evocative and the marriage of the words and the music makes these songs absolutely unique''.<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'SOMM Recordings', NULL, 'FLAC (tracks+booklet)', '01:03:42', '266 MB', 'https://fc.4crp.com/d/grB8H', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-25 12:44:10.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-25 09:44:10', '2018-07-03 06:56:06');

Maghreb United has a range of excellent singers from Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia sitting at the centre of an ecstatic whirl of traditional instrumentation, distorted treatments, and big booming bass and drum patterns. Brilliant, energetic stuff, out on the Glitterbeat label. <br><br>On his debut release, Maghreb United, featuring the singers Mehdi Nassouli (Morocco), Sofiane Saidi (Algeria), and Cheb Hassen Tej (Tunisia), he connects the two to offer a radical, electronic reinvention of ancient North African music. AMMAR 808 started the project in 2017, after working with the lauded Bargou 08, searching for something to link the sense of what has been with what will be. "I''m trying to weave threads from folklore and mythology into futurism. And I''m not necessarily projecting a positive image; from all we can see, things aren''t going in the right direction. What I hope is that it will raise an alarm." Yet there''s also plenty of hope here. With singers from Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco, songs from the Targ, Gnawa, and Raï histories, and a TR-808 alongside a distorted gumbri (Nassouli), gasba flute, and zokra bagpipes (Lassaed Bougalmi), this is an album that reaches out to encompass the entire Maghreb area of North Africa. "In the past the Maghreb was one huge region, yet very diverse within its borders. But today, the world keeps every person separated. The album isn''t so much about a united Maghrebi region, but how we can connect while observing our differences -- our differences are also our connection -- and using them to unify as humans." The choice of songs was also very deliberate for AMMAR 808, with nine of the ten cuts taken from the deep tradition. The idea for Maghreb United (which is also the name for the album''s performing group) has long been burning in AMMAR 808, but it burst into flame after the musician and producer met all the singers on his regular trips in the region, before returning home to start building the tracks. The deep, rumbling growl of the gumbri, the dry, airy tenderness of the gasba, and the softly slithering zokra give a powerful North African root to the music, a thread that spins back through centuries. And the singers burn with fire and grace and passion. <br><br>AMMAR 808<br>Sofiane Saidi, vocals<br>Mehdi Nassouli, vocals<br>Cheb Hassen Tej, vocals <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Glitterbeat', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks+booklet)', '36:27', '85.5 / 219 / 405 MB', 'https://fc.4crp.com/d/YEvlR', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-25 12:46:56.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-25 09:46:57', '2018-07-03 07:22:23'),

It stands to reason that many vital albums come critically close to never being made. The eight-track upshot of doubt, upheaval and financial strain, Stains on Silence by Girls Names is one such release. Following 2015''s blitzing Arms Around a Vision, and the parting of drummer Gib Cassidy just over a year later, the Belfast band suddenly found themselves facing down a looming void. ''There was a finished and then aborted mix of the album, which was shelved for six months,'' reveals Girls Names frontman Cathal Cully. ''We then took a break from all music and went back to full-time work. We chilled out from the stress of rushing the record and not being happy with it, as well as being skint with no impending touring on the cards and constantly having to worry about rent.'' The stumbling blocks that proved a strain became the album''s defining breakthrough. Recorded in various locations including Belfast''s Start Together Studio with Ben McAuley, Cully''s home and the band''s practice space, spontaneous creation, cut-up techniques and self-editing took centre-stage for the first time. ''We started tearing the material apart and rebuilding, re-editing and re-recording different parts in my home in early Autumn last year,'' says Cully. ''When we got them to a place we were happier with we went back into Start Together Studio with Ben McAuley to finalise the mixes to what they are now.'' Where AAAV proved a brazen statement of intent, Stains on Silence bounds forth as its feature-length comedown. What could have seen the band buckle became an opportunity for approaching things tabula rasa. During its two-year transmutation, Cully, bassist Claire Miskimmin and guitarist Philip Quinn had a single aim for their fourth album: to make an old-fashioned record clocking in around 30 to 35 minutes in length that made the listener reach straight for repeat. From the Bang Bang bar-summoning swoon of opener 25 and the submerged disco doom of Haus Proud to the rapt, dub-leaning Fragments of a Portrait , Girls Names have excelled in their goal by forging an LP of synchronous nuance and defiance. Marked by the presence of drum machines and programming throughout, these eight masterfully-woven tales are once again commandeered by founder Cully, whose words, understated yet defiant, mine purpose and meaning from the mire ("I want to bathe again, I want to swim again / In a pool of twisting bodies, blackened gold." 25 ). But while Stains on Silence came critically close to never being made, having lived with it, reconfigured it, and guided its metamorphosis from flickers of inspiration and half-formed schemes, it''s both a statement of pure perseverance, and a head-on confrontation with ambivalence that couldn''t be more assured.

When Rolling Blackouts C.F. started, with Joe Russo [Tom’s brother] on bass, Marcel [Tussie, Joe White''s then-housemate] on drums, the chemistry was immediate. After a split EP with You Yangs (another Russo brother''s band), released in the form of a frisbee, they self-released Talk Tight in 2015, which Sydney-based record label Ivy League gave a wider release the following year. Talk Tight garnered plaudits from critics, including legendary rock scribe Robert Christgau. In 2017, Sub Pop released The French Press EP, bringing the band''s chugging and tuneful non-linear indie rock to the rest of the world as they settled into their sound with remarkable ease. <br><br>Hope Downs was largely written over the past year in the band''s Melbourne rehearsal room where their previous releases were also written and recorded. The band''s core trio of songwriters hunkered down and wrote as the chaos of the world outside unavoidably seeped into the songwriting process. "We were feeling like we were in a moment where the sands were shifting and the world was getting a lot weirder. There was a general sense that things were coming apart at the seams and people around us were too,” Russo explains. The album title, taken from the name of a vast open cut mine in the middle of Australia, refers to the feeling of “standing at the edge of the void of the big unknown, and finding something to hold on to.” <br><br>With the help of engineer/producer Liam Judson and his portable setup, the band recorded Hope Downs live, and co-produced ten guitar pop gems over the course of two weeks in Northern New South Wales during the winter of 2017. Hope Downs possesses a robust full-band sound that''s all the more impressive considering the band''s avoidance of traditional recording studios. If you loved Talk Tight and The French Press, you certainly won''t be disappointed here—but you might also be surprised at how the band’s sound has grown. There''s a richness and weight to these songs that was previously only hinted at, from the skyscraping chorus of “Sister''s Jeans” to the thrilling climax of album closer “The Hammer.” <br><br>Hope Downs is as much about the people that populate the world around us—their stories, perspectives, and hopes in the face of disillusionment—as it is about the state of things at large. It''s a record that focuses on finding the bright spots at a time when cynicism all too often feels like the natural state. Rolling Blackouts C.F. are here to remind us to keep our feet on the ground—and Hope Downs is as delicious a taste of terra firma as you''re going to get from a rock band right now. <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Sub Pop Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-48kHz FLAC (tracks)', '35:17', '83.8 / 244 / 447 MB', 'https://fc.4crp.com/d/usbDOb', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-25 12:47:27.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-25 09:47:27', '2018-07-03 07:33:40'),

She can belt and she can tease; she can aim a note as directly as a missile or turn its trajectory into an aerobatic spiral of leaping, quivering, scalloping melismas. Her voice is not an instrument for making modest statements; it’s about peaks of self-affirmation, indescribable sensual pleasures, steely counterattacks and abysses of sorrow.<br><br>She unleashes all of them on “Liberation,” her eighth studio album and her first since “Lotus” in 2012. It’s a return to the pop fray after multiple seasons as a coach on “The Voice” that made sure viewers didn’t forget her vocal mastery. It’s an album of extreme ups and downs: wretched and ecstatic, calculating and abandoned, seesawing between angst and raunch. Heard as a whole — unlikely as that might be in 2018 — it’s an album that moves through trauma, lust, resistance, obsession and, finally, lasting love. Her extravagant vocal flourishes connect with sweeping emotion.<br><br>Top 10 pop — the realm where Ms. Aguilera has repeatedly proved herself since “Genie in a Bottle” in 1999 — doesn’t always reward big, natural voices as it once did, especially for singers who aren’t named Adele. Auto-Tune; hip-hop; and the nasal, narcotized, dispirited voices of SoundCloud rap compete with, and often out-stream, the kind of soulful vocal storytelling that would have had Ms. Aguilera flourishing in previous eras. A voice like hers has become something like a turntable: a vintage prize, a modern novelty, a niche taste.

At the more robust spectrum of the album with its rousing horn section is ''Warrior'' which is lyrically a spirited show of confidence from one friend to another, whilst on the gentler end of the record comes the tender romanticism of ''Quiet Man'', picked as the album''s title track as the song emerged from what Roo describes as "a place of stillness, peace and contentment".

The record features de-facto band leader Isaiah Barr on alto and tenor saxophone, Austin Williamson on drums, Walter Stinson on upright bass, Spencer Murphy on electric bass, and Roy Nathanson as guest saxophone on four tracks. A group of New York mainstays cross in and out of the Onyx universe and often performing live with the band, including Nick Hakim, Princess Nokia, Dev Hynes (Blood Orange), Wiki (Ratking), Julian Soto and Felix Pastorius. Onyx members quietly feature on a bevy of other artists’ records too, with Barr himself recently boasting 3 features on the new David Byrne album and making a cameo in Ibeyi’s live band for their performance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Whereas previous Onyx Collective projects capture New York City''s more romantic facets, Lower East Suite Part Three has a much more ominous sound, reflective of the dissonance that accompanies life in the city. After being forced out of their original practice space due to rising rent, Onyx Collective relocated their headquarters to Magic Gallery on Market St, located in a gritty pocket of Chinatown by the East River. “When I wrote the record I was thinking about concepts like eviction and gentrification,” explains Barr. “The record is born out of the challenges of being in New York.” <br><br>Recorded at Magic Gallery, Lower East Suite Part Three is the first release from Onyx Collective composed of entirely written music. “The record is a graduation for us - from not just having a microphone at a session and spontaneously recording,” says Barr. “This is us doing it on our own, with our own engineer, with a very low budget. That survival is really what I think jazz is: creating with your surroundings, and making something that''s a picture of that.” While the new music is more premeditated than the impromptu nature of their previous work, New York''s deafening influence remains present. “To some degree it''s controlled, but how much is it actually controlled?” continues Barr. “At the end of one of the songs you can still hear a siren from the street. Because we weren''t in a professional studio, it''s not a controlled environment. We''re still in New York.” <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Big Dada', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks)', '34:53', '83.5 / 214 MB', 'https://fc.4crp.com/d/ePjxcc', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-25 12:51:02.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-25 09:51:02', '2018-07-03 07:36:42'),

Jose Serebrier says: ''My choice of songs for orchestration was dictated primarily by the character of the writing. In most cases, the orchestration seemed so obvious, it almost literally jumped out of the page. I took great care to orchestrate them idiomatically''.

Maghreb United has a range of excellent singers from Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia sitting at the centre of an ecstatic whirl of traditional instrumentation, distorted treatments, and big booming bass and drum patterns. Brilliant, energetic stuff, out on the Glitterbeat label. <br><br>On his debut release, Maghreb United, featuring the singers Mehdi Nassouli (Morocco), Sofiane Saidi (Algeria), and Cheb Hassen Tej (Tunisia), he connects the two to offer a radical, electronic reinvention of ancient North African music. AMMAR 808 started the project in 2017, after working with the lauded Bargou 08, searching for something to link the sense of what has been with what will be. "I''m trying to weave threads from folklore and mythology into futurism. And I''m not necessarily projecting a positive image; from all we can see, things aren''t going in the right direction. What I hope is that it will raise an alarm." Yet there''s also plenty of hope here. With singers from Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco, songs from the Targ, Gnawa, and Raï histories, and a TR-808 alongside a distorted gumbri (Nassouli), gasba flute, and zokra bagpipes (Lassaed Bougalmi), this is an album that reaches out to encompass the entire Maghreb area of North Africa. "In the past the Maghreb was one huge region, yet very diverse within its borders. But today, the world keeps every person separated. The album isn''t so much about a united Maghrebi region, but how we can connect while observing our differences -- our differences are also our connection -- and using them to unify as humans." The choice of songs was also very deliberate for AMMAR 808, with nine of the ten cuts taken from the deep tradition. The idea for Maghreb United (which is also the name for the album''s performing group) has long been burning in AMMAR 808, but it burst into flame after the musician and producer met all the singers on his regular trips in the region, before returning home to start building the tracks. The deep, rumbling growl of the gumbri, the dry, airy tenderness of the gasba, and the softly slithering zokra give a powerful North African root to the music, a thread that spins back through centuries. And the singers burn with fire and grace and passion. <br><br>AMMAR 808<br>Sofiane Saidi, vocals<br>Mehdi Nassouli, vocals<br>Cheb Hassen Tej, vocals <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Glitterbeat', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks+booklet)', '36:27', '85.5 / 219 / 405 MB', 'https://fc.4crp.com/d/dCNFn', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-25 13:55:14.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-25 10:55:14', '2018-07-03 11:11:27'),

It stands to reason that many vital albums come critically close to never being made. The eight-track upshot of doubt, upheaval and financial strain, Stains on Silence by Girls Names is one such release. Following 2015''s blitzing Arms Around a Vision, and the parting of drummer Gib Cassidy just over a year later, the Belfast band suddenly found themselves facing down a looming void. ''There was a finished and then aborted mix of the album, which was shelved for six months,'' reveals Girls Names frontman Cathal Cully. ''We then took a break from all music and went back to full-time work. We chilled out from the stress of rushing the record and not being happy with it, as well as being skint with no impending touring on the cards and constantly having to worry about rent.'' The stumbling blocks that proved a strain became the album''s defining breakthrough. Recorded in various locations including Belfast''s Start Together Studio with Ben McAuley, Cully''s home and the band''s practice space, spontaneous creation, cut-up techniques and self-editing took centre-stage for the first time. ''We started tearing the material apart and rebuilding, re-editing and re-recording different parts in my home in early Autumn last year,'' says Cully. ''When we got them to a place we were happier with we went back into Start Together Studio with Ben McAuley to finalise the mixes to what they are now.'' Where AAAV proved a brazen statement of intent, Stains on Silence bounds forth as its feature-length comedown. What could have seen the band buckle became an opportunity for approaching things tabula rasa. During its two-year transmutation, Cully, bassist Claire Miskimmin and guitarist Philip Quinn had a single aim for their fourth album: to make an old-fashioned record clocking in around 30 to 35 minutes in length that made the listener reach straight for repeat. From the Bang Bang bar-summoning swoon of opener 25 and the submerged disco doom of Haus Proud to the rapt, dub-leaning Fragments of a Portrait , Girls Names have excelled in their goal by forging an LP of synchronous nuance and defiance. Marked by the presence of drum machines and programming throughout, these eight masterfully-woven tales are once again commandeered by founder Cully, whose words, understated yet defiant, mine purpose and meaning from the mire ("I want to bathe again, I want to swim again / In a pool of twisting bodies, blackened gold." 25 ). But while Stains on Silence came critically close to never being made, having lived with it, reconfigured it, and guided its metamorphosis from flickers of inspiration and half-formed schemes, it''s both a statement of pure perseverance, and a head-on confrontation with ambivalence that couldn''t be more assured.

The Hammer 04:29', '<!--QuoteEBegin-->It''s rare that a band''s debut album sounds as confident and self-assured as Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever''s Hope Downs. To say that the first full-length from the Melbourne quintet improves on their buzz-building EPs from the last few years would be an understatement: the promise those early releases hinted at is fully realized here, with ten songs of urgent, passionate guitar pop that elicit warm memories of bands past, from the Go-Betweens'' jangle to the charmingly lo-fi trappings of New Zealand''s Flying Nun label. But don''t mistake Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever for nostalgists: Hope Downs is the sound of a band finding its own collective voice. <br>The hard-hitting debut album is a testament to Rolling Blackouts C.F.’s tight-knit and hard-working bonafides. Prior to forming the band in 2013, singers/guitarists Fran Keaney, Tom Russo, and Joe White had played together in various garage bands, dating back to high school. When Rolling Blackouts C.F. started, with Joe Russo [Tom’s brother] on bass, Marcel [Tussie, Joe White''s then-housemate] on drums, the chemistry was immediate. After a split EP with You Yangs (another Russo brother''s band), released in the form of a frisbee, they self-released Talk Tight in 2015, which Sydney-based record label Ivy League gave a wider release the following year. Talk Tight garnered plaudits from critics, including legendary rock scribe Robert Christgau. In 2017, Sub Pop released The French Press EP, bringing the band''s chugging and tuneful non-linear indie rock to the rest of the world as they settled into their sound with remarkable ease. <br><br>Hope Downs was largely written over the past year in the band''s Melbourne rehearsal room where their previous releases were also written and recorded. The band''s core trio of songwriters hunkered down and wrote as the chaos of the world outside unavoidably seeped into the songwriting process. "We were feeling like we were in a moment where the sands were shifting and the world was getting a lot weirder. There was a general sense that things were coming apart at the seams and people around us were too,” Russo explains. The album title, taken from the name of a vast open cut mine in the middle of Australia, refers to the feeling of “standing at the edge of the void of the big unknown, and finding something to hold on to.” <br><br>With the help of engineer/producer Liam Judson and his portable setup, the band recorded Hope Downs live, and co-produced ten guitar pop gems over the course of two weeks in Northern New South Wales during the winter of 2017. Hope Downs possesses a robust full-band sound that''s all the more impressive considering the band''s avoidance of traditional recording studios. If you loved Talk Tight and The French Press, you certainly won''t be disappointed here—but you might also be surprised at how the band’s sound has grown. There''s a richness and weight to these songs that was previously only hinted at, from the skyscraping chorus of “Sister''s Jeans” to the thrilling climax of album closer “The Hammer.” <br><br>Hope Downs is as much about the people that populate the world around us—their stories, perspectives, and hopes in the face of disillusionment—as it is about the state of things at large. It''s a record that focuses on finding the bright spots at a time when cynicism all too often feels like the natural state. Rolling Blackouts C.F. are here to remind us to keep our feet on the ground—and Hope Downs is as delicious a taste of terra firma as you''re going to get from a rock band right now. <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Sub Pop Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-48kHz FLAC (tracks)', '35:17', '83.8 / 244 / 447 MB', 'https://fc.4crp.com/d/OSP3ib', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-25 13:55:42.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-25 10:55:42', '2018-07-03 11:29:12'),

She can belt and she can tease; she can aim a note as directly as a missile or turn its trajectory into an aerobatic spiral of leaping, quivering, scalloping melismas. Her voice is not an instrument for making modest statements; it’s about peaks of self-affirmation, indescribable sensual pleasures, steely counterattacks and abysses of sorrow.<br><br>She unleashes all of them on “Liberation,” her eighth studio album and her first since “Lotus” in 2012. It’s a return to the pop fray after multiple seasons as a coach on “The Voice” that made sure viewers didn’t forget her vocal mastery. It’s an album of extreme ups and downs: wretched and ecstatic, calculating and abandoned, seesawing between angst and raunch. Heard as a whole — unlikely as that might be in 2018 — it’s an album that moves through trauma, lust, resistance, obsession and, finally, lasting love. Her extravagant vocal flourishes connect with sweeping emotion.<br><br>Top 10 pop — the realm where Ms. Aguilera has repeatedly proved herself since “Genie in a Bottle” in 1999 — doesn’t always reward big, natural voices as it once did, especially for singers who aren’t named Adele. Auto-Tune; hip-hop; and the nasal, narcotized, dispirited voices of SoundCloud rap compete with, and often out-stream, the kind of soulful vocal storytelling that would have had Ms. Aguilera flourishing in previous eras. A voice like hers has become something like a turntable: a vintage prize, a modern novelty, a niche taste.

Sung in Norwegian (with Norwegian texts and English translations in the booklet) the sublime result showcases Grieg at his most evocative, Farley at her most expressive and Serebrier at his most nuanced. Jose Serebrier says: ''My choice of songs for orchestration was dictated primarily by the character of the writing. In most cases, the orchestration seemed so obvious, it almost literally jumped out of the page. I took great care to orchestrate them idiomatically''. Carole Farley says: ''The idea for this recording was to make these under-performed songs available to a wider public.

Maghreb United has a range of excellent singers from Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia sitting at the centre of an ecstatic whirl of traditional instrumentation, distorted treatments, and big booming bass and drum patterns. Brilliant, energetic stuff, out on the Glitterbeat label. <br><br>On his debut release, Maghreb United, featuring the singers Mehdi Nassouli (Morocco), Sofiane Saidi (Algeria), and Cheb Hassen Tej (Tunisia), he connects the two to offer a radical, electronic reinvention of ancient North African music. AMMAR 808 started the project in 2017, after working with the lauded Bargou 08, searching for something to link the sense of what has been with what will be. "I''m trying to weave threads from folklore and mythology into futurism. And I''m not necessarily projecting a positive image; from all we can see, things aren''t going in the right direction. What I hope is that it will raise an alarm." Yet there''s also plenty of hope here. With singers from Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco, songs from the Targ, Gnawa, and Raï histories, and a TR-808 alongside a distorted gumbri (Nassouli), gasba flute, and zokra bagpipes (Lassaed Bougalmi), this is an album that reaches out to encompass the entire Maghreb area of North Africa. "In the past the Maghreb was one huge region, yet very diverse within its borders. But today, the world keeps every person separated. The album isn''t so much about a united Maghrebi region, but how we can connect while observing our differences -- our differences are also our connection -- and using them to unify as humans." The choice of songs was also very deliberate for AMMAR 808, with nine of the ten cuts taken from the deep tradition. The idea for Maghreb United (which is also the name for the album''s performing group) has long been burning in AMMAR 808, but it burst into flame after the musician and producer met all the singers on his regular trips in the region, before returning home to start building the tracks. The deep, rumbling growl of the gumbri, the dry, airy tenderness of the gasba, and the softly slithering zokra give a powerful North African root to the music, a thread that spins back through centuries. And the singers burn with fire and grace and passion. <br><br>AMMAR 808<br>Sofiane Saidi, vocals<br>Mehdi Nassouli, vocals<br>Cheb Hassen Tej, vocals <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Glitterbeat', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks+booklet)', '36:27', '85.5 / 219 / 405 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/7k4fihfb7sf2/Maghreb_United_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-26 09:37:35.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-26 06:37:35', '2018-06-26 06:37:35'),

Following 2015''s blitzing Arms Around a Vision, and the parting of drummer Gib Cassidy just over a year later, the Belfast band suddenly found themselves facing down a looming void. ''There was a finished and then aborted mix of the album, which was shelved for six months,'' reveals Girls Names frontman Cathal Cully. ''We then took a break from all music and went back to full-time work. We chilled out from the stress of rushing the record and not being happy with it, as well as being skint with no impending touring on the cards and constantly having to worry about rent.'' The stumbling blocks that proved a strain became the album''s defining breakthrough. Recorded in various locations including Belfast''s Start Together Studio with Ben McAuley, Cully''s home and the band''s practice space, spontaneous creation, cut-up techniques and self-editing took centre-stage for the first time. ''We started tearing the material apart and rebuilding, re-editing and re-recording different parts in my home in early Autumn last year,'' says Cully. ''When we got them to a place we were happier with we went back into Start Together Studio with Ben McAuley to finalise the mixes to what they are now.'' Where AAAV proved a brazen statement of intent, Stains on Silence bounds forth as its feature-length comedown. What could have seen the band buckle became an opportunity for approaching things tabula rasa. During its two-year transmutation, Cully, bassist Claire Miskimmin and guitarist Philip Quinn had a single aim for their fourth album: to make an old-fashioned record clocking in around 30 to 35 minutes in length that made the listener reach straight for repeat. From the Bang Bang bar-summoning swoon of opener 25 and the submerged disco doom of Haus Proud to the rapt, dub-leaning Fragments of a Portrait , Girls Names have excelled in their goal by forging an LP of synchronous nuance and defiance. Marked by the presence of drum machines and programming throughout, these eight masterfully-woven tales are once again commandeered by founder Cully, whose words, understated yet defiant, mine purpose and meaning from the mire ("I want to bathe again, I want to swim again / In a pool of twisting bodies, blackened gold." 25 ). But while Stains on Silence came critically close to never being made, having lived with it, reconfigured it, and guided its metamorphosis from flickers of inspiration and half-formed schemes, it''s both a statement of pure perseverance, and a head-on confrontation with ambivalence that couldn''t be more assured.

The Hammer 04:29', '<!--QuoteEBegin-->It''s rare that a band''s debut album sounds as confident and self-assured as Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever''s Hope Downs. To say that the first full-length from the Melbourne quintet improves on their buzz-building EPs from the last few years would be an understatement: the promise those early releases hinted at is fully realized here, with ten songs of urgent, passionate guitar pop that elicit warm memories of bands past, from the Go-Betweens'' jangle to the charmingly lo-fi trappings of New Zealand''s Flying Nun label. But don''t mistake Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever for nostalgists: Hope Downs is the sound of a band finding its own collective voice. <br>The hard-hitting debut album is a testament to Rolling Blackouts C.F.’s tight-knit and hard-working bonafides. Prior to forming the band in 2013, singers/guitarists Fran Keaney, Tom Russo, and Joe White had played together in various garage bands, dating back to high school. When Rolling Blackouts C.F. started, with Joe Russo [Tom’s brother] on bass, Marcel [Tussie, Joe White''s then-housemate] on drums, the chemistry was immediate. After a split EP with You Yangs (another Russo brother''s band), released in the form of a frisbee, they self-released Talk Tight in 2015, which Sydney-based record label Ivy League gave a wider release the following year. Talk Tight garnered plaudits from critics, including legendary rock scribe Robert Christgau. In 2017, Sub Pop released The French Press EP, bringing the band''s chugging and tuneful non-linear indie rock to the rest of the world as they settled into their sound with remarkable ease. <br><br>Hope Downs was largely written over the past year in the band''s Melbourne rehearsal room where their previous releases were also written and recorded. The band''s core trio of songwriters hunkered down and wrote as the chaos of the world outside unavoidably seeped into the songwriting process. "We were feeling like we were in a moment where the sands were shifting and the world was getting a lot weirder. There was a general sense that things were coming apart at the seams and people around us were too,” Russo explains. The album title, taken from the name of a vast open cut mine in the middle of Australia, refers to the feeling of “standing at the edge of the void of the big unknown, and finding something to hold on to.” <br><br>With the help of engineer/producer Liam Judson and his portable setup, the band recorded Hope Downs live, and co-produced ten guitar pop gems over the course of two weeks in Northern New South Wales during the winter of 2017. Hope Downs possesses a robust full-band sound that''s all the more impressive considering the band''s avoidance of traditional recording studios. If you loved Talk Tight and The French Press, you certainly won''t be disappointed here—but you might also be surprised at how the band’s sound has grown. There''s a richness and weight to these songs that was previously only hinted at, from the skyscraping chorus of “Sister''s Jeans” to the thrilling climax of album closer “The Hammer.” <br><br>Hope Downs is as much about the people that populate the world around us—their stories, perspectives, and hopes in the face of disillusionment—as it is about the state of things at large. It''s a record that focuses on finding the bright spots at a time when cynicism all too often feels like the natural state. Rolling Blackouts C.F. are here to remind us to keep our feet on the ground—and Hope Downs is as delicious a taste of terra firma as you''re going to get from a rock band right now. <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Sub Pop Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-48kHz FLAC (tracks)', '35:17', '83.8 / 244 / 447 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/zh6c0jp18irs/Hope_Downs_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-26 09:47:46.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-26 06:47:46', '2018-06-26 06:47:46'),

She can belt and she can tease; she can aim a note as directly as a missile or turn its trajectory into an aerobatic spiral of leaping, quivering, scalloping melismas. Her voice is not an instrument for making modest statements; it’s about peaks of self-affirmation, indescribable sensual pleasures, steely counterattacks and abysses of sorrow.<br><br>She unleashes all of them on “Liberation,” her eighth studio album and her first since “Lotus” in 2012. It’s a return to the pop fray after multiple seasons as a coach on “The Voice” that made sure viewers didn’t forget her vocal mastery. It’s an album of extreme ups and downs: wretched and ecstatic, calculating and abandoned, seesawing between angst and raunch. Heard as a whole — unlikely as that might be in 2018 — it’s an album that moves through trauma, lust, resistance, obsession and, finally, lasting love. Her extravagant vocal flourishes connect with sweeping emotion.<br><br>Top 10 pop — the realm where Ms. Aguilera has repeatedly proved herself since “Genie in a Bottle” in 1999 — doesn’t always reward big, natural voices as it once did, especially for singers who aren’t named Adele.

The record features de-facto band leader Isaiah Barr on alto and tenor saxophone, Austin Williamson on drums, Walter Stinson on upright bass, Spencer Murphy on electric bass, and Roy Nathanson as guest saxophone on four tracks. A group of New York mainstays cross in and out of the Onyx universe and often performing live with the band, including Nick Hakim, Princess Nokia, Dev Hynes (Blood Orange), Wiki (Ratking), Julian Soto and Felix Pastorius. Onyx members quietly feature on a bevy of other artists’ records too, with Barr himself recently boasting 3 features on the new David Byrne album and making a cameo in Ibeyi’s live band for their performance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Whereas previous Onyx Collective projects capture New York City''s more romantic facets, Lower East Suite Part Three has a much more ominous sound, reflective of the dissonance that accompanies life in the city. After being forced out of their original practice space due to rising rent, Onyx Collective relocated their headquarters to Magic Gallery on Market St, located in a gritty pocket of Chinatown by the East River. “When I wrote the record I was thinking about concepts like eviction and gentrification,” explains Barr. “The record is born out of the challenges of being in New York.” <br><br>Recorded at Magic Gallery, Lower East Suite Part Three is the first release from Onyx Collective composed of entirely written music. “The record is a graduation for us - from not just having a microphone at a session and spontaneously recording,” says Barr. “This is us doing it on our own, with our own engineer, with a very low budget. That survival is really what I think jazz is: creating with your surroundings, and making something that''s a picture of that.” While the new music is more premeditated than the impromptu nature of their previous work, New York''s deafening influence remains present. “To some degree it''s controlled, but how much is it actually controlled?” continues Barr. “At the end of one of the songs you can still hear a siren from the street. Because we weren''t in a professional studio, it''s not a controlled environment.

The album is available for pre-order today on vinyl, CD or download, along with the new single “Colors In The Dark” which can be streamed or downloaded now. The band’s DNA is evident in the song’s woozy soul with Martin''s robo-coo floating like a hallucination over a lush scene rooted by Hodge’s warm bass and featuring a breezy Glasper piano solo that crests in a sudden burst from Tyson. <br><br>Okayplayer wrote that “R+R=NOW consists of some of the brightest and baddest musicians in the game today,” adding that the album’s first single “Change Of Tone” “finds R+R=NOW fluidly showcasing their individual sounds as a cohesive blend… expressing hope, love, confidence, and resiliency through their respective melodies.” Stereogum declared the song “a powerful introduction to the band, highlighting each members’ skill and spirit,” while Paste called it “a hybrid encompassing all of black music—hip-hop, R&amp;B, jazz, soul, funk—with its layered instrumental laying out black excellence.” <br><br>In an era when every headline carries some new horror or fresh worry, we need music that can clap back with immediacy, skill, and heart. We need a band so at home in its skin that it can play without ego and lead with love—artists whose very existence attests to resilience and hope. We need R+R=NOW, a supergroup assembled by Glasper but functionally egalitarian, in no small part because its members are visionary players, composers, and producers on their own. This genre-mashing outfit moves as one and, as their name reveals, with great purpose. <br><br>“R+R stands for ‘Reflect’ and ‘Respond’,” says Glasper. The idea came to him via Nina Simone while he was coproducing Nina Revisited, a companion album to the 2015 film What Happened, Miss Simone? Facing backlash for her politics, Simone was asked, more or less, why she didn''t just shut up and sing. Her answer: “an artist’s duty, as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times.” Glasper adds: “When you reflect what''s going on in your time and respond to that, you can''t not be relevant. So ‘R’ plus ‘R’ equals ‘NOW’.” <br><br>In that spirit, Collagically Speaking isn''t some wonky thesis on the state of the nation. It’s a raw document that seamlessly adheres neo-soul to future-funk, West Coast jazz of the moment to astral electronica, instrumental hip-hop to musique concrète, avant-garde to classical—these are single-take songs, written live in the room, that go wherever this formidable crew''s mood goes.

This twice Ensor nominated composer and Mercury Prize winning producer delivers a collection of songs, including a duet with his longtime musical partner PJ Harvey, that should change all that. Bird Dog Dante was completed in a busy year for Parish. On top of being the musical director of the extended PJ Harvey band on their Hope Six Demolition Project world tour, he produced acclaimed albums for This is the Kit, Nadine Khouri, and Aldous Harding. <br><br>Parish records songs as they come to him, often with the intent of just capturing the idea. “Like all of my records, Bird Dog Dante was recorded all over the place in odd situations, because I’ll have an idea somewhere and want to record it, then I actually end up liking the sound of that specific recording and want to incorporate it,” says Parish. While a few of the tracks began with the band in Toybox in Bristol, often they were then deconstructed in Parish’s home studio. John’s producer’s ear can focus on a small detail that captures his imagination, which then becomes the foundation to build the song around. On “Rachel,” “Aldous Harding’s beautiful backing vocals were recorded on my phone backstage at her Jools Holland show. I’d been asked to play piano for her, and while we had time to kill in the dressing room before the performance I thought ‘let’s just do the backing vocals now’ – so while listening to the track on my iPhone, she sang into her iPhone. Those vocals were literally recorded with two phones and a pair of earbuds.“ John’s ability to see things for what they are and delight in the details is what makes his work so singular. Exemplified by the album title’s origin, words that just sounded good together, John is an exceptionally skilled artist with a youthful delight and a creative open mind, as well as the ability to masterfully expand on those ideas. It is clear why Uncut said that “Parish is one of Britain’s most resourceful and imaginative studio craftsmen.” <br><br>John’s recent solo records were instrumental, and mostly included works composed for film. While Bird Dog Dante contains a few pieces written for film, it is his first song oriented album in nearly a decade. Working while touring allowed him to bounce lyrics off his long time musical partner PJ Harvey. On “Sorry for Your Loss,” a song about their close friend Mark Linkous, it seemed only fitting to take it further and sing the song as a duet. With his eclectic recording locations and process, Parish brought cohesion to the album by mixing it in a 10 day stretch between bouts of touring. The music is gentle and quiet, not unlike its creator, and its heft comes through its emotional depth and its subtle delights from unexpected sound choices and processing. <br><br>John Parish is very much a family man, so it is fitting that the album became a family affair with artwork created by his daughter Honor and the layout designed by his wife Michelle Henning, who as well as being Professor of Photography at University of West London, was art director for PJ Harvey’s The Hope Six Demolition Project and also responsible for the iconic Let England Shake cover design. In addition to touring with this own band in April, John Parish is playing a commemorative show of Nick Drake’s music at St George’s, Bristol in what would have been Drake’s 70th year. <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Thrill Jockey', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks)', '34:47', '79.8 / 171 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/aaz4jx2ho81a/Bird_Dog_Dante_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-26 10:38:47.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-26 07:38:48', '2018-06-26 07:38:48'),

Their re-evaluation in the decades since, and the ever-increasing number of Drake fans around the world - now stretching into the hundreds of thousands - has a lot to do with Robert Kirby, whose string, brass and woodwind arrangements helped to make the records so distinctive. Totemic of a post-sixties, post-swinging England that wore a greatcoat and kicked up leaves, Kirby''s orchestrations were relaxed, familiar, and entirely autumnal. His talent was appreciated by producer/manager Sandy Roberton, who booked him for other prime British folk-rockers - Ian Matthews, Spirogyra, Shelagh McDonald, Keith Christmas - and by Joe Boyd who asked Kirby to work with Vashti Bunyan. By the end of the decade, when he quit arranging for an office job, there was almost no one in the folk rock canon Robert Kirby hadn''t worked with: Steve Ashley, Shirley Collins, Ralph McTell, Sandy Denny, Richard and Linda Thompson. He came out of retirement at the end of the nineties and had never been busier than he was at the time of his unexpected death in 2009. When The Day Is Done concentrates on his first wave of success, when a Robert Kirby arrangement was a guarantee of something special, a particular melancholic beauty.

Maghreb United has a range of excellent singers from Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia sitting at the centre of an ecstatic whirl of traditional instrumentation, distorted treatments, and big booming bass and drum patterns. Brilliant, energetic stuff, out on the Glitterbeat label. <br><br>On his debut release, Maghreb United, featuring the singers Mehdi Nassouli (Morocco), Sofiane Saidi (Algeria), and Cheb Hassen Tej (Tunisia), he connects the two to offer a radical, electronic reinvention of ancient North African music. AMMAR 808 started the project in 2017, after working with the lauded Bargou 08, searching for something to link the sense of what has been with what will be. "I''m trying to weave threads from folklore and mythology into futurism. And I''m not necessarily projecting a positive image; from all we can see, things aren''t going in the right direction. What I hope is that it will raise an alarm." Yet there''s also plenty of hope here. With singers from Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco, songs from the Targ, Gnawa, and Raï histories, and a TR-808 alongside a distorted gumbri (Nassouli), gasba flute, and zokra bagpipes (Lassaed Bougalmi), this is an album that reaches out to encompass the entire Maghreb area of North Africa. "In the past the Maghreb was one huge region, yet very diverse within its borders. But today, the world keeps every person separated. The album isn''t so much about a united Maghrebi region, but how we can connect while observing our differences -- our differences are also our connection -- and using them to unify as humans." The choice of songs was also very deliberate for AMMAR 808, with nine of the ten cuts taken from the deep tradition. The idea for Maghreb United (which is also the name for the album''s performing group) has long been burning in AMMAR 808, but it burst into flame after the musician and producer met all the singers on his regular trips in the region, before returning home to start building the tracks. The deep, rumbling growl of the gumbri, the dry, airy tenderness of the gasba, and the softly slithering zokra give a powerful North African root to the music, a thread that spins back through centuries. And the singers burn with fire and grace and passion. <br><br>AMMAR 808<br>Sofiane Saidi, vocals<br>Mehdi Nassouli, vocals<br>Cheb Hassen Tej, vocals <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Glitterbeat', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks+booklet)', '36:27', '85.5 / 219 / 405 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/7k4fihfb7sf2/Maghreb_United_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-26 11:44:36.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-26 08:44:36', '2018-06-26 08:44:36'),

After visiting a studio there last year while on tour, I got the idea to bring a group of Tulsa musicians, still carrying the torch of the legendary Tulsa Sound, and toss them in that iconic space and setting along the Tennessee River and see what would happen. What happened in August 2017, with musicians Paul Benjaman, Lauren Barth, John Fullbright, Jesse Aycock, Dylan Aycock, Aaron Boehler, Dustin Pittsley, Michael Staub, and Lauren Farrah, was a combination of mean soulful guitar riffs and loose vibey grooves, with hints of inspiration and influence from Derek And The Dominos, The Band, The Rolling Stones, The Allman Bros, and even Oasis."<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Horton Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks)', '45:10', '105 / 298 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/1v8475pgkglh/Levi_Parham_-_Its_All_Good_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-26 11:54:41.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-26 08:54:42', '2018-06-26 08:54:42'),

It stands to reason that many vital albums come critically close to never being made. The eight-track upshot of doubt, upheaval and financial strain, Stains on Silence by Girls Names is one such release. Following 2015''s blitzing Arms Around a Vision, and the parting of drummer Gib Cassidy just over a year later, the Belfast band suddenly found themselves facing down a looming void. ''There was a finished and then aborted mix of the album, which was shelved for six months,'' reveals Girls Names frontman Cathal Cully. ''We then took a break from all music and went back to full-time work. We chilled out from the stress of rushing the record and not being happy with it, as well as being skint with no impending touring on the cards and constantly having to worry about rent.'' The stumbling blocks that proved a strain became the album''s defining breakthrough. Recorded in various locations including Belfast''s Start Together Studio with Ben McAuley, Cully''s home and the band''s practice space, spontaneous creation, cut-up techniques and self-editing took centre-stage for the first time. ''We started tearing the material apart and rebuilding, re-editing and re-recording different parts in my home in early Autumn last year,'' says Cully. ''When we got them to a place we were happier with we went back into Start Together Studio with Ben McAuley to finalise the mixes to what they are now.'' Where AAAV proved a brazen statement of intent, Stains on Silence bounds forth as its feature-length comedown. What could have seen the band buckle became an opportunity for approaching things tabula rasa. During its two-year transmutation, Cully, bassist Claire Miskimmin and guitarist Philip Quinn had a single aim for their fourth album: to make an old-fashioned record clocking in around 30 to 35 minutes in length that made the listener reach straight for repeat. From the Bang Bang bar-summoning swoon of opener 25 and the submerged disco doom of Haus Proud to the rapt, dub-leaning Fragments of a Portrait , Girls Names have excelled in their goal by forging an LP of synchronous nuance and defiance. Marked by the presence of drum machines and programming throughout, these eight masterfully-woven tales are once again commandeered by founder Cully, whose words, understated yet defiant, mine purpose and meaning from the mire ("I want to bathe again, I want to swim again / In a pool of twisting bodies, blackened gold." 25 ). But while Stains on Silence came critically close to never being made, having lived with it, reconfigured it, and guided its metamorphosis from flickers of inspiration and half-formed schemes, it''s both a statement of pure perseverance, and a head-on confrontation with ambivalence that couldn''t be more assured.

The Hammer 04:29', '<!--QuoteEBegin-->It''s rare that a band''s debut album sounds as confident and self-assured as Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever''s Hope Downs. To say that the first full-length from the Melbourne quintet improves on their buzz-building EPs from the last few years would be an understatement: the promise those early releases hinted at is fully realized here, with ten songs of urgent, passionate guitar pop that elicit warm memories of bands past, from the Go-Betweens'' jangle to the charmingly lo-fi trappings of New Zealand''s Flying Nun label. But don''t mistake Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever for nostalgists: Hope Downs is the sound of a band finding its own collective voice. <br>The hard-hitting debut album is a testament to Rolling Blackouts C.F.’s tight-knit and hard-working bonafides. Prior to forming the band in 2013, singers/guitarists Fran Keaney, Tom Russo, and Joe White had played together in various garage bands, dating back to high school. When Rolling Blackouts C.F. started, with Joe Russo [Tom’s brother] on bass, Marcel [Tussie, Joe White''s then-housemate] on drums, the chemistry was immediate. After a split EP with You Yangs (another Russo brother''s band), released in the form of a frisbee, they self-released Talk Tight in 2015, which Sydney-based record label Ivy League gave a wider release the following year. Talk Tight garnered plaudits from critics, including legendary rock scribe Robert Christgau. In 2017, Sub Pop released The French Press EP, bringing the band''s chugging and tuneful non-linear indie rock to the rest of the world as they settled into their sound with remarkable ease. <br><br>Hope Downs was largely written over the past year in the band''s Melbourne rehearsal room where their previous releases were also written and recorded. The band''s core trio of songwriters hunkered down and wrote as the chaos of the world outside unavoidably seeped into the songwriting process. "We were feeling like we were in a moment where the sands were shifting and the world was getting a lot weirder. There was a general sense that things were coming apart at the seams and people around us were too,” Russo explains. The album title, taken from the name of a vast open cut mine in the middle of Australia, refers to the feeling of “standing at the edge of the void of the big unknown, and finding something to hold on to.” <br><br>With the help of engineer/producer Liam Judson and his portable setup, the band recorded Hope Downs live, and co-produced ten guitar pop gems over the course of two weeks in Northern New South Wales during the winter of 2017. Hope Downs possesses a robust full-band sound that''s all the more impressive considering the band''s avoidance of traditional recording studios. If you loved Talk Tight and The French Press, you certainly won''t be disappointed here—but you might also be surprised at how the band’s sound has grown. There''s a richness and weight to these songs that was previously only hinted at, from the skyscraping chorus of “Sister''s Jeans” to the thrilling climax of album closer “The Hammer.” <br><br>Hope Downs is as much about the people that populate the world around us—their stories, perspectives, and hopes in the face of disillusionment—as it is about the state of things at large. It''s a record that focuses on finding the bright spots at a time when cynicism all too often feels like the natural state. Rolling Blackouts C.F. are here to remind us to keep our feet on the ground—and Hope Downs is as delicious a taste of terra firma as you''re going to get from a rock band right now. <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Sub Pop Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-48kHz FLAC (tracks)', '35:17', '83.8 / 244 / 447 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/zh6c0jp18irs/Hope_Downs_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-26 11:54:47.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-26 08:54:47', '2018-06-26 08:54:47'),

Her voice is not an instrument for making modest statements; it’s about peaks of self-affirmation, indescribable sensual pleasures, steely counterattacks and abysses of sorrow.<br><br>She unleashes all of them on “Liberation,” her eighth studio album and her first since “Lotus” in 2012. It’s a return to the pop fray after multiple seasons as a coach on “The Voice” that made sure viewers didn’t forget her vocal mastery. It’s an album of extreme ups and downs: wretched and ecstatic, calculating and abandoned, seesawing between angst and raunch. Heard as a whole — unlikely as that might be in 2018 — it’s an album that moves through trauma, lust, resistance, obsession and, finally, lasting love.

A group of New York mainstays cross in and out of the Onyx universe and often performing live with the band, including Nick Hakim, Princess Nokia, Dev Hynes (Blood Orange), Wiki (Ratking), Julian Soto and Felix Pastorius.

Whereas previous Onyx Collective projects capture New York City''s more romantic facets, Lower East Suite Part Three has a much more ominous sound, reflective of the dissonance that accompanies life in the city. After being forced out of their original practice space due to rising rent, Onyx Collective relocated their headquarters to Magic Gallery on Market St, located in a gritty pocket of Chinatown by the East River. “When I wrote the record I was thinking about concepts like eviction and gentrification,” explains Barr. “The record is born out of the challenges of being in New York.” <br><br>Recorded at Magic Gallery, Lower East Suite Part Three is the first release from Onyx Collective composed of entirely written music. “The record is a graduation for us - from not just having a microphone at a session and spontaneously recording,” says Barr. “This is us doing it on our own, with our own engineer, with a very low budget. That survival is really what I think jazz is: creating with your surroundings, and making something that''s a picture of that.” While the new music is more premeditated than the impromptu nature of their previous work, New York''s deafening influence remains present. “To some degree it''s controlled, but how much is it actually controlled?” continues Barr. “At the end of one of the songs you can still hear a siren from the street.

The band’s DNA is evident in the song’s woozy soul with Martin''s robo-coo floating like a hallucination over a lush scene rooted by Hodge’s warm bass and featuring a breezy Glasper piano solo that crests in a sudden burst from Tyson. <br><br>Okayplayer wrote that “R+R=NOW consists of some of the brightest and baddest musicians in the game today,” adding that the album’s first single “Change Of Tone” “finds R+R=NOW fluidly showcasing their individual sounds as a cohesive blend… expressing hope, love, confidence, and resiliency through their respective melodies.” Stereogum declared the song “a powerful introduction to the band, highlighting each members’ skill and spirit,” while Paste called it “a hybrid encompassing all of black music—hip-hop, R&amp;B, jazz, soul, funk—with its layered instrumental laying out black excellence.” <br><br>In an era when every headline carries some new horror or fresh worry, we need music that can clap back with immediacy, skill, and heart. We need a band so at home in its skin that it can play without ego and lead with love—artists whose very existence attests to resilience and hope. We need R+R=NOW, a supergroup assembled by Glasper but functionally egalitarian, in no small part because its members are visionary players, composers, and producers on their own. This genre-mashing outfit moves as one and, as their name reveals, with great purpose. <br><br>“R+R stands for ‘Reflect’ and ‘Respond’,” says Glasper. The idea came to him via Nina Simone while he was coproducing Nina Revisited, a companion album to the 2015 film What Happened, Miss Simone? Facing backlash for her politics, Simone was asked, more or less, why she didn''t just shut up and sing. Her answer: “an artist’s duty, as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times.” Glasper adds: “When you reflect what''s going on in your time and respond to that, you can''t not be relevant. So ‘R’ plus ‘R’ equals ‘NOW’.” <br><br>In that spirit, Collagically Speaking isn''t some wonky thesis on the state of the nation. It’s a raw document that seamlessly adheres neo-soul to future-funk, West Coast jazz of the moment to astral electronica, instrumental hip-hop to musique concrète, avant-garde to classical—these are single-take songs, written live in the room, that go wherever this formidable crew''s mood goes. Guest voices get caught in that mix as well: actors Omari Hardwick (Power) and Terry Crews (Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Expendables); actress Amanda Seales (Insecure); MCs Stalley and yasiin bey (f.k.a. Mos Def); and singers Amber Navran (of Moonchild) and Goapele. The themes that bind it all together are both spoken and inferred: romantic love, universal love, systemic bigotry, the women''s movement, quiet power, wild creativity, personal loss and growth. <br><br>“Everyone in this band is a six-foot-tall black guy who didn''t come from an affluent background,” says Scott. “In order for us all to make it into that room together, we''ve had to go through some hell, fight for some things, build up a lot of armor, and do a lot ourselves to forge our realities, to become who we are. We''re all very aware of that, so anytime we get together, it''s a celebration.” <br><br>Robert Glasper, keyboards<br>Terrace Martin, synthesizer, vocoder, saxophone<br>Christian Scott Stunde ad Juah, trumpet<br>Derrick Hodge, double bass<br>Taylor McFerrin, synthesizer, beatbox<br>Justin Tyson, drums<br>Terry Crews, spoken words<br>Amanda Seales, spoken words<br>Amber Navran, vocals <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Blue Note', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-96kHz FLAC (tracks)', '73:18', '168 / 448 MB / 1.29 GB', 'https://isra.cloud/8iogpx8u5n4u/Collagically_Speaking_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-26 12:45:45.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-26 09:45:46', '2018-06-26 09:45:46'),

The First Star', '<!--QuoteEBegin-->John Parish’s list of musical accomplishments is long, yet for years the self-effacing Bristol native has been happy outside the spotlight. This twice Ensor nominated composer and Mercury Prize winning producer delivers a collection of songs, including a duet with his longtime musical partner PJ Harvey, that should change all that. Bird Dog Dante was completed in a busy year for Parish. On top of being the musical director of the extended PJ Harvey band on their Hope Six Demolition Project world tour, he produced acclaimed albums for This is the Kit, Nadine Khouri, and Aldous Harding. <br><br>Parish records songs as they come to him, often with the intent of just capturing the idea. “Like all of my records, Bird Dog Dante was recorded all over the place in odd situations, because I’ll have an idea somewhere and want to record it, then I actually end up liking the sound of that specific recording and want to incorporate it,” says Parish. While a few of the tracks began with the band in Toybox in Bristol, often they were then deconstructed in Parish’s home studio. John’s producer’s ear can focus on a small detail that captures his imagination, which then becomes the foundation to build the song around. On “Rachel,” “Aldous Harding’s beautiful backing vocals were recorded on my phone backstage at her Jools Holland show. I’d been asked to play piano for her, and while we had time to kill in the dressing room before the performance I thought ‘let’s just do the backing vocals now’ – so while listening to the track on my iPhone, she sang into her iPhone. Those vocals were literally recorded with two phones and a pair of earbuds.“ John’s ability to see things for what they are and delight in the details is what makes his work so singular. Exemplified by the album title’s origin, words that just sounded good together, John is an exceptionally skilled artist with a youthful delight and a creative open mind, as well as the ability to masterfully expand on those ideas. It is clear why Uncut said that “Parish is one of Britain’s most resourceful and imaginative studio craftsmen.” <br><br>John’s recent solo records were instrumental, and mostly included works composed for film. While Bird Dog Dante contains a few pieces written for film, it is his first song oriented album in nearly a decade. Working while touring allowed him to bounce lyrics off his long time musical partner PJ Harvey. On “Sorry for Your Loss,” a song about their close friend Mark Linkous, it seemed only fitting to take it further and sing the song as a duet. With his eclectic recording locations and process, Parish brought cohesion to the album by mixing it in a 10 day stretch between bouts of touring. The music is gentle and quiet, not unlike its creator, and its heft comes through its emotional depth and its subtle delights from unexpected sound choices and processing. <br><br>John Parish is very much a family man, so it is fitting that the album became a family affair with artwork created by his daughter Honor and the layout designed by his wife Michelle Henning, who as well as being Professor of Photography at University of West London, was art director for PJ Harvey’s The Hope Six Demolition Project and also responsible for the iconic Let England Shake cover design. In addition to touring with this own band in April, John Parish is playing a commemorative show of Nick Drake’s music at St George’s, Bristol in what would have been Drake’s 70th year. <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Thrill Jockey', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks)', '34:47', '79.8 / 171 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/aaz4jx2ho81a/Bird_Dog_Dante_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-26 12:45:46.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-26 09:45:47', '2018-06-26 09:45:47'),

Here he plays on a design of the French horn that would have been a standard for the 19th century and beyond. The singular sound of this instrument, as heard on this album, harkens back to some of the best virtuosic players of the golden age of the design. The repertoire of Planel, Tomasi, Bozza, Gounod, Dukas, Saint-Saens and others are presented as these composers intended and “heard” their works to be played on this French valved instrument. The technical competence required for each track is unique, as some of them were regarded as a test of the highest level of performance. The Saint-Saens and Gounod tracks are included as examples of the pure vocal treatment of the horn by two of France’s greatest composers. The Dukas track was the first conservatory test-piece for horn to specifically exploit the newly “legitimized” valve instrument. Tomasi describes what he composed in this way: “I write for the public at large. Music that doesn’t come from the heart isn’t music.” Listening to this album will give you a peek into a world of the French horn which has seldom been heard, and certainly not in one collection such as this, played by one of the instrument’s best and most studied masters.<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Affetto Recordings', NULL, 'FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-96kHz FLAC (tracks+booklet)', '60:49', '176 / 975 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/17bjymzguqdo/Le_cor_francais_authentique_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-26 13:06:02.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-26 10:06:02', '2018-06-26 10:06:02'),

On this album they present as world premiere recording Berlin Chamber Music at the time of Friedrich dem Großen (Frederick the Great). The commonality of the selected sonatas by respected composers such as Johann Gottlieb Janitsch (1708-1763), Christian Gottfried Krause (1717-1770) and Johann Gottlieb Graun (1703-1771) is the solo instrument oboe. In the shadow of the flute, the favorite instrument of Friedrich dem Großen (Frederick the Great), the role of the oboe at the Prussian Court was underestimated for a long time. However there is still a variety of sonatas and concerts for this instrument which survived from this time. The Quintet in A minor by Graun, who was concertmaster of the Royal Court Orchestra since 1741, is characterized by frequent and unexpected changes of affects, dynamics and harmonies in order to achieve expressive and sentimental effects. In contrast to this work are the Trio Sonata in A minor, the Quadro Sonata in B-flat major and the Trio Sonata in G major by Janitsch, who became a violinist in the Court Orchestra in 1736. His works are much more influenced by a gallant style with varied melodies. The Trio Sonata in D minor by Krause is particularly fascinating in its original third movement, in which the oboe enters into a dialogue with the violin. A recording of beautiful Baroque music in unique interpretations.<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'deutsche harmonia mundi', NULL, 'FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-48kHz FLAC (tracks+booklet)', '59:23', '307 / 660 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/ut6o1p4738yd/Forgotten_Chamber_Works_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-26 13:06:08.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-26 10:06:08', '2018-06-26 10:06:08'),

Over the course of his prolific career, the German composer proved that he could write for any instrument as well, and that very notion became something of a mission for him- to ensure that each instrument had its share of solo repertoire. Convergent Winds, a new recording from Oberlin Music, showcases five sonatas Hindemith wrote for woodwinds. It features performances by a host of esteemed Oberlin Conservatory faculty: clarinetist Richard Hawkins, pianist James Howsmon, flutist Alexa Still, oboist and English hornist Robert Walters, and retired bassoonist George Skakeeny. The works were written between 1936- a time when Hindemith’s music was banned from performance in Nazi Germany- to 1942, by which time he has resettled in America. For Howsmon, a longtime professor of instrumental accompanying at Oberlin, the recording pays tribute to an exacting neoclassicist whose music has unfairly fallen out of fashion. “Rather than being a huge innovator, Hindemith took his inspiration from past eras, and yet he had a really wonderful approach to it,” Howsmon says. “He took old models and made them look new, and no matter how wild he gets, you can always find where his starting point was, and it was always 150 years before. He’s like a master furniture builder- a total craftsman. There have been others who have done that, of course, but to me he is the best of them.<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Oberlin Music', NULL, 'FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-96kHz FLAC (tracks+booklet)', '65:13', '232 MB / 1.15 GB', 'https://isra.cloud/2g9hjalwat7e/Convergent_Winds_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-26 13:06:11.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-26 10:06:11', '2018-06-26 10:06:11'),

Composed between 1894 and 1938, these immensely varied, beautifully crafted works – never before heard on disc – illustrate fascinating aspects of Bantock''s artistry and music. The carefully chosen, exquisitely played programme reveals the breadth, delicacy and deliberateness of what Robert Matthew-Walker describes in his booklet notes as Bantock’s ''always clever structuring and drily eloquent style''. Among the gems to be discovered here are Memories of Sapphire, three beautiful lyrical tone poems recalling a visit to North Carolina and dedicated to the composer''s mother; the richly impressionistic Barcarolle showing Bantock''s piano writing at its finest; the late, lively Parade March and the striking piano transcription of the symphonic overture Saul, with its early hints of the orientalism that would later prove so significant to Bantock''s music.

Miles Davis grew up in St. Louis where he heard such St. Louis trumpeters as Clark Terry, Irving Randolph and Shorty Baker when he was a boy, so Miles followed the “St. Louis trumpet tradition”. In the state of Texas it is tenor players, most of who seem to have grown up with big sounds and plenty of confidence, men such as Illinois Jacquet, Arnett Cobb, Jimmy Giuffre and King Curtis. But the Texas tenor is George Holmes “Buddy” Tate, born in Sherman, Texas on February 22, 1914, and now a much travelled and highly respected soloist whose very presence in a club is a guarantee of capacity crowds and a feeling of well-being. When long-service medals are distributed for work with big bands then Buddy must be considered for he was with Count Basie for six months in 1934 then, from the spring of 1939, he was in the Basie saxophone section for more than ten years. He took Herschal Evans’ place and sat alongside a succession of tenor playing colleagues including Lester Young, Paul Bascombe, Don Byas, Lucky Thompson, Illinois Jacquet and Paul Gonsalves. With such grounding it is hardly surprising that Buddy is every inch a professional or that his solo playing is strongly affected by the blues. He has an acute understanding of what an audience wants, which probably accounts for the fact that he took a seven-piece band into Harlem’s “Celebrity Club” in 1952 and was still pleasing the crowd there nearly 20 years later. In 1959 he made his first trip to Europe, as a member of Buck Clayton’s band, and since then he has been back almost every year. In 1970 he brought the complete “Celebrity Club” band over for a European tour but most often Buddy works on this side of the Atlantic as a soloist with local musicians. He tries not to be typecast in terms of material. I heard him open the first set at London’s “Seven Dials” jazz club one night at the end of 1974 with On Green Dolphin Street which must have surprised a number of people in the capacity audience.

Released by Dinemec Classics in 1998, ''Carole Farley sings Grieg Songs'' follows Somm''s acclaimed recording of Grieg''s Piano Concerto and Piano Concerto No. 2 (arranged and orchestrated by Robert Matthew-Walker) by Mark Bebbington. Sensational American soprano Carole Farley brings enormous passion and exquisite poetry to intensely personal songs originally composed for piano accompaniment but here richly orchestrated by Jose Serebrier. Sung in Norwegian (with Norwegian texts and English translations in the booklet) the sublime result showcases Grieg at his most evocative, Farley at her most expressive and Serebrier at his most nuanced. Jose Serebrier says: ''My choice of songs for orchestration was dictated primarily by the character of the writing. In most cases, the orchestration seemed so obvious, it almost literally jumped out of the page. I took great care to orchestrate them idiomatically''. Carole Farley says: ''The idea for this recording was to make these under-performed songs available to a wider public. The poetry is so very evocative and the marriage of the words and the music makes these songs absolutely unique''.<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'SOMM Recordings', NULL, 'FLAC (tracks+booklet)', '01:03:42', '266 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/1h3684n4flww/Carole_Farley_-_Grieg_Songs.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-26 16:50:43.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-26 13:50:43', '2018-06-26 13:50:43'),

Maghreb United has a range of excellent singers from Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia sitting at the centre of an ecstatic whirl of traditional instrumentation, distorted treatments, and big booming bass and drum patterns. Brilliant, energetic stuff, out on the Glitterbeat label. <br><br>On his debut release, Maghreb United, featuring the singers Mehdi Nassouli (Morocco), Sofiane Saidi (Algeria), and Cheb Hassen Tej (Tunisia), he connects the two to offer a radical, electronic reinvention of ancient North African music. AMMAR 808 started the project in 2017, after working with the lauded Bargou 08, searching for something to link the sense of what has been with what will be. "I''m trying to weave threads from folklore and mythology into futurism. And I''m not necessarily projecting a positive image; from all we can see, things aren''t going in the right direction. What I hope is that it will raise an alarm." Yet there''s also plenty of hope here. With singers from Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco, songs from the Targ, Gnawa, and Raï histories, and a TR-808 alongside a distorted gumbri (Nassouli), gasba flute, and zokra bagpipes (Lassaed Bougalmi), this is an album that reaches out to encompass the entire Maghreb area of North Africa. "In the past the Maghreb was one huge region, yet very diverse within its borders. But today, the world keeps every person separated. The album isn''t so much about a united Maghrebi region, but how we can connect while observing our differences -- our differences are also our connection -- and using them to unify as humans." The choice of songs was also very deliberate for AMMAR 808, with nine of the ten cuts taken from the deep tradition. The idea for Maghreb United (which is also the name for the album''s performing group) has long been burning in AMMAR 808, but it burst into flame after the musician and producer met all the singers on his regular trips in the region, before returning home to start building the tracks. The deep, rumbling growl of the gumbri, the dry, airy tenderness of the gasba, and the softly slithering zokra give a powerful North African root to the music, a thread that spins back through centuries. And the singers burn with fire and grace and passion. <br><br>AMMAR 808<br>Sofiane Saidi, vocals<br>Mehdi Nassouli, vocals<br>Cheb Hassen Tej, vocals <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Glitterbeat', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks+booklet)', '36:27', '85.5 / 219 / 405 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/7k4fihfb7sf2/Maghreb_United_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-26 16:52:00.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-26 13:52:00', '2018-06-26 13:52:00'),

It stands to reason that many vital albums come critically close to never being made. The eight-track upshot of doubt, upheaval and financial strain, Stains on Silence by Girls Names is one such release. Following 2015''s blitzing Arms Around a Vision, and the parting of drummer Gib Cassidy just over a year later, the Belfast band suddenly found themselves facing down a looming void. ''There was a finished and then aborted mix of the album, which was shelved for six months,'' reveals Girls Names frontman Cathal Cully. ''We then took a break from all music and went back to full-time work. We chilled out from the stress of rushing the record and not being happy with it, as well as being skint with no impending touring on the cards and constantly having to worry about rent.'' The stumbling blocks that proved a strain became the album''s defining breakthrough. Recorded in various locations including Belfast''s Start Together Studio with Ben McAuley, Cully''s home and the band''s practice space, spontaneous creation, cut-up techniques and self-editing took centre-stage for the first time. ''We started tearing the material apart and rebuilding, re-editing and re-recording different parts in my home in early Autumn last year,'' says Cully. ''When we got them to a place we were happier with we went back into Start Together Studio with Ben McAuley to finalise the mixes to what they are now.'' Where AAAV proved a brazen statement of intent, Stains on Silence bounds forth as its feature-length comedown. What could have seen the band buckle became an opportunity for approaching things tabula rasa. During its two-year transmutation, Cully, bassist Claire Miskimmin and guitarist Philip Quinn had a single aim for their fourth album: to make an old-fashioned record clocking in around 30 to 35 minutes in length that made the listener reach straight for repeat. From the Bang Bang bar-summoning swoon of opener 25 and the submerged disco doom of Haus Proud to the rapt, dub-leaning Fragments of a Portrait , Girls Names have excelled in their goal by forging an LP of synchronous nuance and defiance. Marked by the presence of drum machines and programming throughout, these eight masterfully-woven tales are once again commandeered by founder Cully, whose words, understated yet defiant, mine purpose and meaning from the mire ("I want to bathe again, I want to swim again / In a pool of twisting bodies, blackened gold." 25 ). But while Stains on Silence came critically close to never being made, having lived with it, reconfigured it, and guided its metamorphosis from flickers of inspiration and half-formed schemes, it''s both a statement of pure perseverance, and a head-on confrontation with ambivalence that couldn''t be more assured.

The Hammer 04:29', '<!--QuoteEBegin-->It''s rare that a band''s debut album sounds as confident and self-assured as Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever''s Hope Downs. To say that the first full-length from the Melbourne quintet improves on their buzz-building EPs from the last few years would be an understatement: the promise those early releases hinted at is fully realized here, with ten songs of urgent, passionate guitar pop that elicit warm memories of bands past, from the Go-Betweens'' jangle to the charmingly lo-fi trappings of New Zealand''s Flying Nun label. But don''t mistake Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever for nostalgists: Hope Downs is the sound of a band finding its own collective voice. <br>The hard-hitting debut album is a testament to Rolling Blackouts C.F.’s tight-knit and hard-working bonafides. Prior to forming the band in 2013, singers/guitarists Fran Keaney, Tom Russo, and Joe White had played together in various garage bands, dating back to high school. When Rolling Blackouts C.F. started, with Joe Russo [Tom’s brother] on bass, Marcel [Tussie, Joe White''s then-housemate] on drums, the chemistry was immediate. After a split EP with You Yangs (another Russo brother''s band), released in the form of a frisbee, they self-released Talk Tight in 2015, which Sydney-based record label Ivy League gave a wider release the following year. Talk Tight garnered plaudits from critics, including legendary rock scribe Robert Christgau. In 2017, Sub Pop released The French Press EP, bringing the band''s chugging and tuneful non-linear indie rock to the rest of the world as they settled into their sound with remarkable ease. <br><br>Hope Downs was largely written over the past year in the band''s Melbourne rehearsal room where their previous releases were also written and recorded. The band''s core trio of songwriters hunkered down and wrote as the chaos of the world outside unavoidably seeped into the songwriting process. "We were feeling like we were in a moment where the sands were shifting and the world was getting a lot weirder. There was a general sense that things were coming apart at the seams and people around us were too,” Russo explains. The album title, taken from the name of a vast open cut mine in the middle of Australia, refers to the feeling of “standing at the edge of the void of the big unknown, and finding something to hold on to.” <br><br>With the help of engineer/producer Liam Judson and his portable setup, the band recorded Hope Downs live, and co-produced ten guitar pop gems over the course of two weeks in Northern New South Wales during the winter of 2017. Hope Downs possesses a robust full-band sound that''s all the more impressive considering the band''s avoidance of traditional recording studios. If you loved Talk Tight and The French Press, you certainly won''t be disappointed here—but you might also be surprised at how the band’s sound has grown. There''s a richness and weight to these songs that was previously only hinted at, from the skyscraping chorus of “Sister''s Jeans” to the thrilling climax of album closer “The Hammer.” <br><br>Hope Downs is as much about the people that populate the world around us—their stories, perspectives, and hopes in the face of disillusionment—as it is about the state of things at large. It''s a record that focuses on finding the bright spots at a time when cynicism all too often feels like the natural state. Rolling Blackouts C.F. are here to remind us to keep our feet on the ground—and Hope Downs is as delicious a taste of terra firma as you''re going to get from a rock band right now. <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Sub Pop Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-48kHz FLAC (tracks)', '35:17', '83.8 / 244 / 447 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/zh6c0jp18irs/Hope_Downs_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-26 16:52:46.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-26 13:52:46', '2018-06-26 13:52:46'),

It’s a return to the pop fray after multiple seasons as a coach on “The Voice” that made sure viewers didn’t forget her vocal mastery. It’s an album of extreme ups and downs: wretched and ecstatic, calculating and abandoned, seesawing between angst and raunch. Heard as a whole — unlikely as that might be in 2018 — it’s an album that moves through trauma, lust, resistance, obsession and, finally, lasting love.

After being forced out of their original practice space due to rising rent, Onyx Collective relocated their headquarters to Magic Gallery on Market St, located in a gritty pocket of Chinatown by the East River. “When I wrote the record I was thinking about concepts like eviction and gentrification,” explains Barr. “The record is born out of the challenges of being in New York.” <br><br>Recorded at Magic Gallery, Lower East Suite Part Three is the first release from Onyx Collective composed of entirely written music. “The record is a graduation for us - from not just having a microphone at a session and spontaneously recording,” says Barr. “This is us doing it on our own, with our own engineer, with a very low budget. That survival is really what I think jazz is: creating with your surroundings, and making something that''s a picture of that.” While the new music is more premeditated than the impromptu nature of their previous work, New York''s deafening influence remains present. “To some degree it''s controlled, but how much is it actually controlled?” continues Barr. “At the end of one of the songs you can still hear a siren from the street. Because we weren''t in a professional studio, it''s not a controlled environment. We''re still in New York.” <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Big Dada', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks)', '34:53', '83.5 / 214 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/qfc2a67onh86/Lower_East_Suite_Part_Three_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-26 16:55:38.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-26 13:55:38', '2018-06-26 13:55:38'),

Sung in Norwegian (with Norwegian texts and English translations in the booklet) the sublime result showcases Grieg at his most evocative, Farley at her most expressive and Serebrier at his most nuanced. Jose Serebrier says: ''My choice of songs for orchestration was dictated primarily by the character of the writing. In most cases, the orchestration seemed so obvious, it almost literally jumped out of the page. I took great care to orchestrate them idiomatically''. Carole Farley says: ''The idea for this recording was to make these under-performed songs available to a wider public.

Maghreb United has a range of excellent singers from Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia sitting at the centre of an ecstatic whirl of traditional instrumentation, distorted treatments, and big booming bass and drum patterns. Brilliant, energetic stuff, out on the Glitterbeat label. <br><br>On his debut release, Maghreb United, featuring the singers Mehdi Nassouli (Morocco), Sofiane Saidi (Algeria), and Cheb Hassen Tej (Tunisia), he connects the two to offer a radical, electronic reinvention of ancient North African music. AMMAR 808 started the project in 2017, after working with the lauded Bargou 08, searching for something to link the sense of what has been with what will be. "I''m trying to weave threads from folklore and mythology into futurism. And I''m not necessarily projecting a positive image; from all we can see, things aren''t going in the right direction. What I hope is that it will raise an alarm." Yet there''s also plenty of hope here. With singers from Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco, songs from the Targ, Gnawa, and Raï histories, and a TR-808 alongside a distorted gumbri (Nassouli), gasba flute, and zokra bagpipes (Lassaed Bougalmi), this is an album that reaches out to encompass the entire Maghreb area of North Africa. "In the past the Maghreb was one huge region, yet very diverse within its borders. But today, the world keeps every person separated. The album isn''t so much about a united Maghrebi region, but how we can connect while observing our differences -- our differences are also our connection -- and using them to unify as humans." The choice of songs was also very deliberate for AMMAR 808, with nine of the ten cuts taken from the deep tradition. The idea for Maghreb United (which is also the name for the album''s performing group) has long been burning in AMMAR 808, but it burst into flame after the musician and producer met all the singers on his regular trips in the region, before returning home to start building the tracks. The deep, rumbling growl of the gumbri, the dry, airy tenderness of the gasba, and the softly slithering zokra give a powerful North African root to the music, a thread that spins back through centuries. And the singers burn with fire and grace and passion. <br><br>AMMAR 808<br>Sofiane Saidi, vocals<br>Mehdi Nassouli, vocals<br>Cheb Hassen Tej, vocals <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Glitterbeat', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks+booklet)', '36:27', '85.5 / 219 / 405 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/7k4fihfb7sf2/Maghreb_United_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-26 19:09:56.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-26 16:09:56', '2018-06-26 16:09:56'),

It stands to reason that many vital albums come critically close to never being made. The eight-track upshot of doubt, upheaval and financial strain, Stains on Silence by Girls Names is one such release. Following 2015''s blitzing Arms Around a Vision, and the parting of drummer Gib Cassidy just over a year later, the Belfast band suddenly found themselves facing down a looming void. ''There was a finished and then aborted mix of the album, which was shelved for six months,'' reveals Girls Names frontman Cathal Cully. ''We then took a break from all music and went back to full-time work. We chilled out from the stress of rushing the record and not being happy with it, as well as being skint with no impending touring on the cards and constantly having to worry about rent.'' The stumbling blocks that proved a strain became the album''s defining breakthrough. Recorded in various locations including Belfast''s Start Together Studio with Ben McAuley, Cully''s home and the band''s practice space, spontaneous creation, cut-up techniques and self-editing took centre-stage for the first time. ''We started tearing the material apart and rebuilding, re-editing and re-recording different parts in my home in early Autumn last year,'' says Cully. ''When we got them to a place we were happier with we went back into Start Together Studio with Ben McAuley to finalise the mixes to what they are now.'' Where AAAV proved a brazen statement of intent, Stains on Silence bounds forth as its feature-length comedown. What could have seen the band buckle became an opportunity for approaching things tabula rasa. During its two-year transmutation, Cully, bassist Claire Miskimmin and guitarist Philip Quinn had a single aim for their fourth album: to make an old-fashioned record clocking in around 30 to 35 minutes in length that made the listener reach straight for repeat. From the Bang Bang bar-summoning swoon of opener 25 and the submerged disco doom of Haus Proud to the rapt, dub-leaning Fragments of a Portrait , Girls Names have excelled in their goal by forging an LP of synchronous nuance and defiance. Marked by the presence of drum machines and programming throughout, these eight masterfully-woven tales are once again commandeered by founder Cully, whose words, understated yet defiant, mine purpose and meaning from the mire ("I want to bathe again, I want to swim again / In a pool of twisting bodies, blackened gold." 25 ). But while Stains on Silence came critically close to never being made, having lived with it, reconfigured it, and guided its metamorphosis from flickers of inspiration and half-formed schemes, it''s both a statement of pure perseverance, and a head-on confrontation with ambivalence that couldn''t be more assured.

The Hammer 04:29', '<!--QuoteEBegin-->It''s rare that a band''s debut album sounds as confident and self-assured as Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever''s Hope Downs. To say that the first full-length from the Melbourne quintet improves on their buzz-building EPs from the last few years would be an understatement: the promise those early releases hinted at is fully realized here, with ten songs of urgent, passionate guitar pop that elicit warm memories of bands past, from the Go-Betweens'' jangle to the charmingly lo-fi trappings of New Zealand''s Flying Nun label. But don''t mistake Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever for nostalgists: Hope Downs is the sound of a band finding its own collective voice. <br>The hard-hitting debut album is a testament to Rolling Blackouts C.F.’s tight-knit and hard-working bonafides. Prior to forming the band in 2013, singers/guitarists Fran Keaney, Tom Russo, and Joe White had played together in various garage bands, dating back to high school. When Rolling Blackouts C.F. started, with Joe Russo [Tom’s brother] on bass, Marcel [Tussie, Joe White''s then-housemate] on drums, the chemistry was immediate. After a split EP with You Yangs (another Russo brother''s band), released in the form of a frisbee, they self-released Talk Tight in 2015, which Sydney-based record label Ivy League gave a wider release the following year. Talk Tight garnered plaudits from critics, including legendary rock scribe Robert Christgau. In 2017, Sub Pop released The French Press EP, bringing the band''s chugging and tuneful non-linear indie rock to the rest of the world as they settled into their sound with remarkable ease. <br><br>Hope Downs was largely written over the past year in the band''s Melbourne rehearsal room where their previous releases were also written and recorded. The band''s core trio of songwriters hunkered down and wrote as the chaos of the world outside unavoidably seeped into the songwriting process. "We were feeling like we were in a moment where the sands were shifting and the world was getting a lot weirder. There was a general sense that things were coming apart at the seams and people around us were too,” Russo explains. The album title, taken from the name of a vast open cut mine in the middle of Australia, refers to the feeling of “standing at the edge of the void of the big unknown, and finding something to hold on to.” <br><br>With the help of engineer/producer Liam Judson and his portable setup, the band recorded Hope Downs live, and co-produced ten guitar pop gems over the course of two weeks in Northern New South Wales during the winter of 2017. Hope Downs possesses a robust full-band sound that''s all the more impressive considering the band''s avoidance of traditional recording studios. If you loved Talk Tight and The French Press, you certainly won''t be disappointed here—but you might also be surprised at how the band’s sound has grown. There''s a richness and weight to these songs that was previously only hinted at, from the skyscraping chorus of “Sister''s Jeans” to the thrilling climax of album closer “The Hammer.” <br><br>Hope Downs is as much about the people that populate the world around us—their stories, perspectives, and hopes in the face of disillusionment—as it is about the state of things at large. It''s a record that focuses on finding the bright spots at a time when cynicism all too often feels like the natural state. Rolling Blackouts C.F. are here to remind us to keep our feet on the ground—and Hope Downs is as delicious a taste of terra firma as you''re going to get from a rock band right now. <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Sub Pop Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-48kHz FLAC (tracks)', '35:17', '83.8 / 244 / 447 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/zh6c0jp18irs/Hope_Downs_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-26 19:10:43.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-26 16:10:43', '2018-06-26 16:10:43'),

She can belt and she can tease; she can aim a note as directly as a missile or turn its trajectory into an aerobatic spiral of leaping, quivering, scalloping melismas. Her voice is not an instrument for making modest statements; it’s about peaks of self-affirmation, indescribable sensual pleasures, steely counterattacks and abysses of sorrow.<br><br>She unleashes all of them on “Liberation,” her eighth studio album and her first since “Lotus” in 2012. It’s a return to the pop fray after multiple seasons as a coach on “The Voice” that made sure viewers didn’t forget her vocal mastery. It’s an album of extreme ups and downs: wretched and ecstatic, calculating and abandoned, seesawing between angst and raunch. Heard as a whole — unlikely as that might be in 2018 — it’s an album that moves through trauma, lust, resistance, obsession and, finally, lasting love. Her extravagant vocal flourishes connect with sweeping emotion.<br><br>Top 10 pop — the realm where Ms. Aguilera has repeatedly proved herself since “Genie in a Bottle” in 1999 — doesn’t always reward big, natural voices as it once did, especially for singers who aren’t named Adele.

The record features de-facto band leader Isaiah Barr on alto and tenor saxophone, Austin Williamson on drums, Walter Stinson on upright bass, Spencer Murphy on electric bass, and Roy Nathanson as guest saxophone on four tracks. A group of New York mainstays cross in and out of the Onyx universe and often performing live with the band, including Nick Hakim, Princess Nokia, Dev Hynes (Blood Orange), Wiki (Ratking), Julian Soto and Felix Pastorius. Onyx members quietly feature on a bevy of other artists’ records too, with Barr himself recently boasting 3 features on the new David Byrne album and making a cameo in Ibeyi’s live band for their performance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Whereas previous Onyx Collective projects capture New York City''s more romantic facets, Lower East Suite Part Three has a much more ominous sound, reflective of the dissonance that accompanies life in the city. After being forced out of their original practice space due to rising rent, Onyx Collective relocated their headquarters to Magic Gallery on Market St, located in a gritty pocket of Chinatown by the East River. “When I wrote the record I was thinking about concepts like eviction and gentrification,” explains Barr. “The record is born out of the challenges of being in New York.” <br><br>Recorded at Magic Gallery, Lower East Suite Part Three is the first release from Onyx Collective composed of entirely written music. “The record is a graduation for us - from not just having a microphone at a session and spontaneously recording,” says Barr. “This is us doing it on our own, with our own engineer, with a very low budget. That survival is really what I think jazz is: creating with your surroundings, and making something that''s a picture of that.” While the new music is more premeditated than the impromptu nature of their previous work, New York''s deafening influence remains present. “To some degree it''s controlled, but how much is it actually controlled?” continues Barr. “At the end of one of the songs you can still hear a siren from the street. Because we weren''t in a professional studio, it''s not a controlled environment. We''re still in New York.” <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Big Dada', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks)', '34:53', '83.5 / 214 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/qfc2a67onh86/Lower_East_Suite_Part_Three_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-26 19:13:29.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-26 16:13:29', '2018-06-26 16:13:29'),

In most cases, the orchestration seemed so obvious, it almost literally jumped out of the page. I took great care to orchestrate them idiomatically''.

Maghreb United has a range of excellent singers from Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia sitting at the centre of an ecstatic whirl of traditional instrumentation, distorted treatments, and big booming bass and drum patterns. Brilliant, energetic stuff, out on the Glitterbeat label. <br><br>On his debut release, Maghreb United, featuring the singers Mehdi Nassouli (Morocco), Sofiane Saidi (Algeria), and Cheb Hassen Tej (Tunisia), he connects the two to offer a radical, electronic reinvention of ancient North African music. AMMAR 808 started the project in 2017, after working with the lauded Bargou 08, searching for something to link the sense of what has been with what will be. "I''m trying to weave threads from folklore and mythology into futurism. And I''m not necessarily projecting a positive image; from all we can see, things aren''t going in the right direction. What I hope is that it will raise an alarm." Yet there''s also plenty of hope here. With singers from Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco, songs from the Targ, Gnawa, and Raï histories, and a TR-808 alongside a distorted gumbri (Nassouli), gasba flute, and zokra bagpipes (Lassaed Bougalmi), this is an album that reaches out to encompass the entire Maghreb area of North Africa. "In the past the Maghreb was one huge region, yet very diverse within its borders. But today, the world keeps every person separated. The album isn''t so much about a united Maghrebi region, but how we can connect while observing our differences -- our differences are also our connection -- and using them to unify as humans." The choice of songs was also very deliberate for AMMAR 808, with nine of the ten cuts taken from the deep tradition. The idea for Maghreb United (which is also the name for the album''s performing group) has long been burning in AMMAR 808, but it burst into flame after the musician and producer met all the singers on his regular trips in the region, before returning home to start building the tracks. The deep, rumbling growl of the gumbri, the dry, airy tenderness of the gasba, and the softly slithering zokra give a powerful North African root to the music, a thread that spins back through centuries. And the singers burn with fire and grace and passion. <br><br>AMMAR 808<br>Sofiane Saidi, vocals<br>Mehdi Nassouli, vocals<br>Cheb Hassen Tej, vocals <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Glitterbeat', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks+booklet)', '36:27', '85.5 / 219 / 405 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/7k4fihfb7sf2/Maghreb_United_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-27 07:46:13.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-27 04:46:13', '2018-06-27 04:46:13'),

It stands to reason that many vital albums come critically close to never being made. The eight-track upshot of doubt, upheaval and financial strain, Stains on Silence by Girls Names is one such release. Following 2015''s blitzing Arms Around a Vision, and the parting of drummer Gib Cassidy just over a year later, the Belfast band suddenly found themselves facing down a looming void. ''There was a finished and then aborted mix of the album, which was shelved for six months,'' reveals Girls Names frontman Cathal Cully. ''We then took a break from all music and went back to full-time work. We chilled out from the stress of rushing the record and not being happy with it, as well as being skint with no impending touring on the cards and constantly having to worry about rent.'' The stumbling blocks that proved a strain became the album''s defining breakthrough. Recorded in various locations including Belfast''s Start Together Studio with Ben McAuley, Cully''s home and the band''s practice space, spontaneous creation, cut-up techniques and self-editing took centre-stage for the first time. ''We started tearing the material apart and rebuilding, re-editing and re-recording different parts in my home in early Autumn last year,'' says Cully. ''When we got them to a place we were happier with we went back into Start Together Studio with Ben McAuley to finalise the mixes to what they are now.'' Where AAAV proved a brazen statement of intent, Stains on Silence bounds forth as its feature-length comedown. What could have seen the band buckle became an opportunity for approaching things tabula rasa. During its two-year transmutation, Cully, bassist Claire Miskimmin and guitarist Philip Quinn had a single aim for their fourth album: to make an old-fashioned record clocking in around 30 to 35 minutes in length that made the listener reach straight for repeat. From the Bang Bang bar-summoning swoon of opener 25 and the submerged disco doom of Haus Proud to the rapt, dub-leaning Fragments of a Portrait , Girls Names have excelled in their goal by forging an LP of synchronous nuance and defiance. Marked by the presence of drum machines and programming throughout, these eight masterfully-woven tales are once again commandeered by founder Cully, whose words, understated yet defiant, mine purpose and meaning from the mire ("I want to bathe again, I want to swim again / In a pool of twisting bodies, blackened gold." 25 ). But while Stains on Silence came critically close to never being made, having lived with it, reconfigured it, and guided its metamorphosis from flickers of inspiration and half-formed schemes, it''s both a statement of pure perseverance, and a head-on confrontation with ambivalence that couldn''t be more assured.

To say that the first full-length from the Melbourne quintet improves on their buzz-building EPs from the last few years would be an understatement: the promise those early releases hinted at is fully realized here, with ten songs of urgent, passionate guitar pop that elicit warm memories of bands past, from the Go-Betweens'' jangle to the charmingly lo-fi trappings of New Zealand''s Flying Nun label. But don''t mistake Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever for nostalgists: Hope Downs is the sound of a band finding its own collective voice. <br>The hard-hitting debut album is a testament to Rolling Blackouts C.F.’s tight-knit and hard-working bonafides. Prior to forming the band in 2013, singers/guitarists Fran Keaney, Tom Russo, and Joe White had played together in various garage bands, dating back to high school. When Rolling Blackouts C.F. started, with Joe Russo [Tom’s brother] on bass, Marcel [Tussie, Joe White''s then-housemate] on drums, the chemistry was immediate. After a split EP with You Yangs (another Russo brother''s band), released in the form of a frisbee, they self-released Talk Tight in 2015, which Sydney-based record label Ivy League gave a wider release the following year. Talk Tight garnered plaudits from critics, including legendary rock scribe Robert Christgau. In 2017, Sub Pop released The French Press EP, bringing the band''s chugging and tuneful non-linear indie rock to the rest of the world as they settled into their sound with remarkable ease. <br><br>Hope Downs was largely written over the past year in the band''s Melbourne rehearsal room where their previous releases were also written and recorded. The band''s core trio of songwriters hunkered down and wrote as the chaos of the world outside unavoidably seeped into the songwriting process. "We were feeling like we were in a moment where the sands were shifting and the world was getting a lot weirder. There was a general sense that things were coming apart at the seams and people around us were too,” Russo explains. The album title, taken from the name of a vast open cut mine in the middle of Australia, refers to the feeling of “standing at the edge of the void of the big unknown, and finding something to hold on to.” <br><br>With the help of engineer/producer Liam Judson and his portable setup, the band recorded Hope Downs live, and co-produced ten guitar pop gems over the course of two weeks in Northern New South Wales during the winter of 2017. Hope Downs possesses a robust full-band sound that''s all the more impressive considering the band''s avoidance of traditional recording studios. If you loved Talk Tight and The French Press, you certainly won''t be disappointed here—but you might also be surprised at how the band’s sound has grown. There''s a richness and weight to these songs that was previously only hinted at, from the skyscraping chorus of “Sister''s Jeans” to the thrilling climax of album closer “The Hammer.” <br><br>Hope Downs is as much about the people that populate the world around us—their stories, perspectives, and hopes in the face of disillusionment—as it is about the state of things at large. It''s a record that focuses on finding the bright spots at a time when cynicism all too often feels like the natural state. Rolling Blackouts C.F. are here to remind us to keep our feet on the ground—and Hope Downs is as delicious a taste of terra firma as you''re going to get from a rock band right now. <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Sub Pop Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-48kHz FLAC (tracks)', '35:17', '83.8 / 244 / 447 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/zh6c0jp18irs/Hope_Downs_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-27 07:46:59.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-27 04:46:59', '2018-06-27 04:46:59'),

She can belt and she can tease; she can aim a note as directly as a missile or turn its trajectory into an aerobatic spiral of leaping, quivering, scalloping melismas. Her voice is not an instrument for making modest statements; it’s about peaks of self-affirmation, indescribable sensual pleasures, steely counterattacks and abysses of sorrow.<br><br>She unleashes all of them on “Liberation,” her eighth studio album and her first since “Lotus” in 2012. It’s a return to the pop fray after multiple seasons as a coach on “The Voice” that made sure viewers didn’t forget her vocal mastery. It’s an album of extreme ups and downs: wretched and ecstatic, calculating and abandoned, seesawing between angst and raunch. Heard as a whole — unlikely as that might be in 2018 — it’s an album that moves through trauma, lust, resistance, obsession and, finally, lasting love. Her extravagant vocal flourishes connect with sweeping emotion.<br><br>Top 10 pop — the realm where Ms. Aguilera has repeatedly proved herself since “Genie in a Bottle” in 1999 — doesn’t always reward big, natural voices as it once did, especially for singers who aren’t named Adele. Auto-Tune; hip-hop; and the nasal, narcotized, dispirited voices of SoundCloud rap compete with, and often out-stream, the kind of soulful vocal storytelling that would have had Ms. Aguilera flourishing in previous eras. A voice like hers has become something like a turntable: a vintage prize, a modern novelty, a niche taste.

The record features de-facto band leader Isaiah Barr on alto and tenor saxophone, Austin Williamson on drums, Walter Stinson on upright bass, Spencer Murphy on electric bass, and Roy Nathanson as guest saxophone on four tracks. A group of New York mainstays cross in and out of the Onyx universe and often performing live with the band, including Nick Hakim, Princess Nokia, Dev Hynes (Blood Orange), Wiki (Ratking), Julian Soto and Felix Pastorius. Onyx members quietly feature on a bevy of other artists’ records too, with Barr himself recently boasting 3 features on the new David Byrne album and making a cameo in Ibeyi’s live band for their performance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Whereas previous Onyx Collective projects capture New York City''s more romantic facets, Lower East Suite Part Three has a much more ominous sound, reflective of the dissonance that accompanies life in the city. After being forced out of their original practice space due to rising rent, Onyx Collective relocated their headquarters to Magic Gallery on Market St, located in a gritty pocket of Chinatown by the East River. “When I wrote the record I was thinking about concepts like eviction and gentrification,” explains Barr. “The record is born out of the challenges of being in New York.” <br><br>Recorded at Magic Gallery, Lower East Suite Part Three is the first release from Onyx Collective composed of entirely written music. “The record is a graduation for us - from not just having a microphone at a session and spontaneously recording,” says Barr. “This is us doing it on our own, with our own engineer, with a very low budget. That survival is really what I think jazz is: creating with your surroundings, and making something that''s a picture of that.” While the new music is more premeditated than the impromptu nature of their previous work, New York''s deafening influence remains present. “To some degree it''s controlled, but how much is it actually controlled?” continues Barr. “At the end of one of the songs you can still hear a siren from the street. Because we weren''t in a professional studio, it''s not a controlled environment. We''re still in New York.” <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Big Dada', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks)', '34:53', '83.5 / 214 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/qfc2a67onh86/Lower_East_Suite_Part_Three_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-27 07:49:45.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-27 04:49:45', '2018-06-27 04:49:45');

Released by Dinemec Classics in 1998, ''Carole Farley sings Grieg Songs'' follows Somm''s acclaimed recording of Grieg''s Piano Concerto and Piano Concerto No. 2 (arranged and orchestrated by Robert Matthew-Walker) by Mark Bebbington. Sensational American soprano Carole Farley brings enormous passion and exquisite poetry to intensely personal songs originally composed for piano accompaniment but here richly orchestrated by Jose Serebrier. Sung in Norwegian (with Norwegian texts and English translations in the booklet) the sublime result showcases Grieg at his most evocative, Farley at her most expressive and Serebrier at his most nuanced. Jose Serebrier says: ''My choice of songs for orchestration was dictated primarily by the character of the writing. In most cases, the orchestration seemed so obvious, it almost literally jumped out of the page. I took great care to orchestrate them idiomatically''. Carole Farley says: ''The idea for this recording was to make these under-performed songs available to a wider public.

Maghreb United has a range of excellent singers from Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia sitting at the centre of an ecstatic whirl of traditional instrumentation, distorted treatments, and big booming bass and drum patterns. Brilliant, energetic stuff, out on the Glitterbeat label. <br><br>On his debut release, Maghreb United, featuring the singers Mehdi Nassouli (Morocco), Sofiane Saidi (Algeria), and Cheb Hassen Tej (Tunisia), he connects the two to offer a radical, electronic reinvention of ancient North African music. AMMAR 808 started the project in 2017, after working with the lauded Bargou 08, searching for something to link the sense of what has been with what will be. "I''m trying to weave threads from folklore and mythology into futurism. And I''m not necessarily projecting a positive image; from all we can see, things aren''t going in the right direction. What I hope is that it will raise an alarm." Yet there''s also plenty of hope here. With singers from Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco, songs from the Targ, Gnawa, and Raï histories, and a TR-808 alongside a distorted gumbri (Nassouli), gasba flute, and zokra bagpipes (Lassaed Bougalmi), this is an album that reaches out to encompass the entire Maghreb area of North Africa. "In the past the Maghreb was one huge region, yet very diverse within its borders. But today, the world keeps every person separated. The album isn''t so much about a united Maghrebi region, but how we can connect while observing our differences -- our differences are also our connection -- and using them to unify as humans." The choice of songs was also very deliberate for AMMAR 808, with nine of the ten cuts taken from the deep tradition. The idea for Maghreb United (which is also the name for the album''s performing group) has long been burning in AMMAR 808, but it burst into flame after the musician and producer met all the singers on his regular trips in the region, before returning home to start building the tracks. The deep, rumbling growl of the gumbri, the dry, airy tenderness of the gasba, and the softly slithering zokra give a powerful North African root to the music, a thread that spins back through centuries. And the singers burn with fire and grace and passion. <br><br>AMMAR 808<br>Sofiane Saidi, vocals<br>Mehdi Nassouli, vocals<br>Cheb Hassen Tej, vocals <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Glitterbeat', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks+booklet)', '36:27', '85.5 / 219 / 405 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/7k4fihfb7sf2/Maghreb_United_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-27 12:08:12.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-27 09:08:12', '2018-06-27 09:08:12'),

What happened in August 2017, with musicians Paul Benjaman, Lauren Barth, John Fullbright, Jesse Aycock, Dylan Aycock, Aaron Boehler, Dustin Pittsley, Michael Staub, and Lauren Farrah, was a combination of mean soulful guitar riffs and loose vibey grooves, with hints of inspiration and influence from Derek And The Dominos, The Band, The Rolling Stones, The Allman Bros, and even Oasis."<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Horton Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks)', '45:10', '105 / 298 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/1v8475pgkglh/Levi_Parham_-_Its_All_Good_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-27 12:08:40.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-27 09:08:40', '2018-06-27 09:08:40'),

It stands to reason that many vital albums come critically close to never being made. The eight-track upshot of doubt, upheaval and financial strain, Stains on Silence by Girls Names is one such release. Following 2015''s blitzing Arms Around a Vision, and the parting of drummer Gib Cassidy just over a year later, the Belfast band suddenly found themselves facing down a looming void. ''There was a finished and then aborted mix of the album, which was shelved for six months,'' reveals Girls Names frontman Cathal Cully. ''We then took a break from all music and went back to full-time work. We chilled out from the stress of rushing the record and not being happy with it, as well as being skint with no impending touring on the cards and constantly having to worry about rent.'' The stumbling blocks that proved a strain became the album''s defining breakthrough. Recorded in various locations including Belfast''s Start Together Studio with Ben McAuley, Cully''s home and the band''s practice space, spontaneous creation, cut-up techniques and self-editing took centre-stage for the first time. ''We started tearing the material apart and rebuilding, re-editing and re-recording different parts in my home in early Autumn last year,'' says Cully. ''When we got them to a place we were happier with we went back into Start Together Studio with Ben McAuley to finalise the mixes to what they are now.'' Where AAAV proved a brazen statement of intent, Stains on Silence bounds forth as its feature-length comedown. What could have seen the band buckle became an opportunity for approaching things tabula rasa. During its two-year transmutation, Cully, bassist Claire Miskimmin and guitarist Philip Quinn had a single aim for their fourth album: to make an old-fashioned record clocking in around 30 to 35 minutes in length that made the listener reach straight for repeat. From the Bang Bang bar-summoning swoon of opener 25 and the submerged disco doom of Haus Proud to the rapt, dub-leaning Fragments of a Portrait , Girls Names have excelled in their goal by forging an LP of synchronous nuance and defiance. Marked by the presence of drum machines and programming throughout, these eight masterfully-woven tales are once again commandeered by founder Cully, whose words, understated yet defiant, mine purpose and meaning from the mire ("I want to bathe again, I want to swim again / In a pool of twisting bodies, blackened gold." 25 ). But while Stains on Silence came critically close to never being made, having lived with it, reconfigured it, and guided its metamorphosis from flickers of inspiration and half-formed schemes, it''s both a statement of pure perseverance, and a head-on confrontation with ambivalence that couldn''t be more assured.

The Hammer 04:29', '<!--QuoteEBegin-->It''s rare that a band''s debut album sounds as confident and self-assured as Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever''s Hope Downs. To say that the first full-length from the Melbourne quintet improves on their buzz-building EPs from the last few years would be an understatement: the promise those early releases hinted at is fully realized here, with ten songs of urgent, passionate guitar pop that elicit warm memories of bands past, from the Go-Betweens'' jangle to the charmingly lo-fi trappings of New Zealand''s Flying Nun label. But don''t mistake Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever for nostalgists: Hope Downs is the sound of a band finding its own collective voice. <br>The hard-hitting debut album is a testament to Rolling Blackouts C.F.’s tight-knit and hard-working bonafides. Prior to forming the band in 2013, singers/guitarists Fran Keaney, Tom Russo, and Joe White had played together in various garage bands, dating back to high school. When Rolling Blackouts C.F. started, with Joe Russo [Tom’s brother] on bass, Marcel [Tussie, Joe White''s then-housemate] on drums, the chemistry was immediate. After a split EP with You Yangs (another Russo brother''s band), released in the form of a frisbee, they self-released Talk Tight in 2015, which Sydney-based record label Ivy League gave a wider release the following year. Talk Tight garnered plaudits from critics, including legendary rock scribe Robert Christgau. In 2017, Sub Pop released The French Press EP, bringing the band''s chugging and tuneful non-linear indie rock to the rest of the world as they settled into their sound with remarkable ease. <br><br>Hope Downs was largely written over the past year in the band''s Melbourne rehearsal room where their previous releases were also written and recorded. The band''s core trio of songwriters hunkered down and wrote as the chaos of the world outside unavoidably seeped into the songwriting process. "We were feeling like we were in a moment where the sands were shifting and the world was getting a lot weirder. There was a general sense that things were coming apart at the seams and people around us were too,” Russo explains. The album title, taken from the name of a vast open cut mine in the middle of Australia, refers to the feeling of “standing at the edge of the void of the big unknown, and finding something to hold on to.” <br><br>With the help of engineer/producer Liam Judson and his portable setup, the band recorded Hope Downs live, and co-produced ten guitar pop gems over the course of two weeks in Northern New South Wales during the winter of 2017. Hope Downs possesses a robust full-band sound that''s all the more impressive considering the band''s avoidance of traditional recording studios. If you loved Talk Tight and The French Press, you certainly won''t be disappointed here—but you might also be surprised at how the band’s sound has grown. There''s a richness and weight to these songs that was previously only hinted at, from the skyscraping chorus of “Sister''s Jeans” to the thrilling climax of album closer “The Hammer.” <br><br>Hope Downs is as much about the people that populate the world around us—their stories, perspectives, and hopes in the face of disillusionment—as it is about the state of things at large. It''s a record that focuses on finding the bright spots at a time when cynicism all too often feels like the natural state. Rolling Blackouts C.F. are here to remind us to keep our feet on the ground—and Hope Downs is as delicious a taste of terra firma as you''re going to get from a rock band right now. <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Sub Pop Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-48kHz FLAC (tracks)', '35:17', '83.8 / 244 / 447 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/zh6c0jp18irs/Hope_Downs_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-27 12:09:03.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-27 09:09:03', '2018-06-27 09:09:03'),

She can belt and she can tease; she can aim a note as directly as a missile or turn its trajectory into an aerobatic spiral of leaping, quivering, scalloping melismas. Her voice is not an instrument for making modest statements; it’s about peaks of self-affirmation, indescribable sensual pleasures, steely counterattacks and abysses of sorrow.<br><br>She unleashes all of them on “Liberation,” her eighth studio album and her first since “Lotus” in 2012. It’s a return to the pop fray after multiple seasons as a coach on “The Voice” that made sure viewers didn’t forget her vocal mastery. It’s an album of extreme ups and downs: wretched and ecstatic, calculating and abandoned, seesawing between angst and raunch. Heard as a whole — unlikely as that might be in 2018 — it’s an album that moves through trauma, lust, resistance, obsession and, finally, lasting love. Her extravagant vocal flourishes connect with sweeping emotion.<br><br>Top 10 pop — the realm where Ms. Aguilera has repeatedly proved herself since “Genie in a Bottle” in 1999 — doesn’t always reward big, natural voices as it once did, especially for singers who aren’t named Adele. Auto-Tune; hip-hop; and the nasal, narcotized, dispirited voices of SoundCloud rap compete with, and often out-stream, the kind of soulful vocal storytelling that would have had Ms. Aguilera flourishing in previous eras.

A group of New York mainstays cross in and out of the Onyx universe and often performing live with the band, including Nick Hakim, Princess Nokia, Dev Hynes (Blood Orange), Wiki (Ratking), Julian Soto and Felix Pastorius.

Whereas previous Onyx Collective projects capture New York City''s more romantic facets, Lower East Suite Part Three has a much more ominous sound, reflective of the dissonance that accompanies life in the city. After being forced out of their original practice space due to rising rent, Onyx Collective relocated their headquarters to Magic Gallery on Market St, located in a gritty pocket of Chinatown by the East River. “When I wrote the record I was thinking about concepts like eviction and gentrification,” explains Barr. “The record is born out of the challenges of being in New York.” <br><br>Recorded at Magic Gallery, Lower East Suite Part Three is the first release from Onyx Collective composed of entirely written music. “The record is a graduation for us - from not just having a microphone at a session and spontaneously recording,” says Barr. “This is us doing it on our own, with our own engineer, with a very low budget. That survival is really what I think jazz is: creating with your surroundings, and making something that''s a picture of that.” While the new music is more premeditated than the impromptu nature of their previous work, New York''s deafening influence remains present. “To some degree it''s controlled, but how much is it actually controlled?” continues Barr. “At the end of one of the songs you can still hear a siren from the street.

Carole Farley says: ''The idea for this recording was to make these under-performed songs available to a wider public.

Released by Dinemec Classics in 1998, ''Carole Farley sings Grieg Songs'' follows Somm''s acclaimed recording of Grieg''s Piano Concerto and Piano Concerto No. 2 (arranged and orchestrated by Robert Matthew-Walker) by Mark Bebbington. Sensational American soprano Carole Farley brings enormous passion and exquisite poetry to intensely personal songs originally composed for piano accompaniment but here richly orchestrated by Jose Serebrier. Sung in Norwegian (with Norwegian texts and English translations in the booklet) the sublime result showcases Grieg at his most evocative, Farley at her most expressive and Serebrier at his most nuanced. Jose Serebrier says: ''My choice of songs for orchestration was dictated primarily by the character of the writing. In most cases, the orchestration seemed so obvious, it almost literally jumped out of the page. I took great care to orchestrate them idiomatically''. Carole Farley says: ''The idea for this recording was to make these under-performed songs available to a wider public. The poetry is so very evocative and the marriage of the words and the music makes these songs absolutely unique''.<!--QuoteEnd-->', 'SOMM Recordings', NULL, 'FLAC (tracks+booklet)', '01:03:42', '266 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/1h3684n4flww/Carole_Farley_-_Grieg_Songs.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-29 10:01:49.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-29 07:01:49', '2018-06-29 07:01:49'),

Maghreb United has a range of excellent singers from Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia sitting at the centre of an ecstatic whirl of traditional instrumentation, distorted treatments, and big booming bass and drum patterns. Brilliant, energetic stuff, out on the Glitterbeat label. <br><br>On his debut release, Maghreb United, featuring the singers Mehdi Nassouli (Morocco), Sofiane Saidi (Algeria), and Cheb Hassen Tej (Tunisia), he connects the two to offer a radical, electronic reinvention of ancient North African music. AMMAR 808 started the project in 2017, after working with the lauded Bargou 08, searching for something to link the sense of what has been with what will be. "I''m trying to weave threads from folklore and mythology into futurism. And I''m not necessarily projecting a positive image; from all we can see, things aren''t going in the right direction. What I hope is that it will raise an alarm." Yet there''s also plenty of hope here. With singers from Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco, songs from the Targ, Gnawa, and Raï histories, and a TR-808 alongside a distorted gumbri (Nassouli), gasba flute, and zokra bagpipes (Lassaed Bougalmi), this is an album that reaches out to encompass the entire Maghreb area of North Africa. "In the past the Maghreb was one huge region, yet very diverse within its borders. But today, the world keeps every person separated. The album isn''t so much about a united Maghrebi region, but how we can connect while observing our differences -- our differences are also our connection -- and using them to unify as humans." The choice of songs was also very deliberate for AMMAR 808, with nine of the ten cuts taken from the deep tradition. The idea for Maghreb United (which is also the name for the album''s performing group) has long been burning in AMMAR 808, but it burst into flame after the musician and producer met all the singers on his regular trips in the region, before returning home to start building the tracks. The deep, rumbling growl of the gumbri, the dry, airy tenderness of the gasba, and the softly slithering zokra give a powerful North African root to the music, a thread that spins back through centuries. And the singers burn with fire and grace and passion. <br><br>AMMAR 808<br>Sofiane Saidi, vocals<br>Mehdi Nassouli, vocals<br>Cheb Hassen Tej, vocals <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Glitterbeat', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-44.1kHz FLAC (tracks+booklet)', '36:27', '85.5 / 219 / 405 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/7k4fihfb7sf2/Maghreb_United_Hi-Res.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-29 10:03:05.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-29 07:03:05', '2018-06-29 07:03:05'),

In Parham''s own words: "I''ve always been an admirer of the music that''s come out of Muscle Shoals, from Aretha Franklin to The Allman Bros. After visiting a studio there last year while on tour, I got the idea to bring a group of Tulsa musicians, still carrying the torch of the legendary Tulsa Sound, and toss them in that iconic space and setting along the Tennessee River and see what would happen.

It stands to reason that many vital albums come critically close to never being made. The eight-track upshot of doubt, upheaval and financial strain, Stains on Silence by Girls Names is one such release. Following 2015''s blitzing Arms Around a Vision, and the parting of drummer Gib Cassidy just over a year later, the Belfast band suddenly found themselves facing down a looming void. ''There was a finished and then aborted mix of the album, which was shelved for six months,'' reveals Girls Names frontman Cathal Cully. ''We then took a break from all music and went back to full-time work. We chilled out from the stress of rushing the record and not being happy with it, as well as being skint with no impending touring on the cards and constantly having to worry about rent.'' The stumbling blocks that proved a strain became the album''s defining breakthrough. Recorded in various locations including Belfast''s Start Together Studio with Ben McAuley, Cully''s home and the band''s practice space, spontaneous creation, cut-up techniques and self-editing took centre-stage for the first time. ''We started tearing the material apart and rebuilding, re-editing and re-recording different parts in my home in early Autumn last year,'' says Cully. ''When we got them to a place we were happier with we went back into Start Together Studio with Ben McAuley to finalise the mixes to what they are now.'' Where AAAV proved a brazen statement of intent, Stains on Silence bounds forth as its feature-length comedown. What could have seen the band buckle became an opportunity for approaching things tabula rasa. During its two-year transmutation, Cully, bassist Claire Miskimmin and guitarist Philip Quinn had a single aim for their fourth album: to make an old-fashioned record clocking in around 30 to 35 minutes in length that made the listener reach straight for repeat. From the Bang Bang bar-summoning swoon of opener 25 and the submerged disco doom of Haus Proud to the rapt, dub-leaning Fragments of a Portrait , Girls Names have excelled in their goal by forging an LP of synchronous nuance and defiance. Marked by the presence of drum machines and programming throughout, these eight masterfully-woven tales are once again commandeered by founder Cully, whose words, understated yet defiant, mine purpose and meaning from the mire ("I want to bathe again, I want to swim again / In a pool of twisting bodies, blackened gold." 25 ). But while Stains on Silence came critically close to never being made, having lived with it, reconfigured it, and guided its metamorphosis from flickers of inspiration and half-formed schemes, it''s both a statement of pure perseverance, and a head-on confrontation with ambivalence that couldn''t be more assured.

The Hammer 04:29', '<!--QuoteEBegin-->It''s rare that a band''s debut album sounds as confident and self-assured as Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever''s Hope Downs. To say that the first full-length from the Melbourne quintet improves on their buzz-building EPs from the last few years would be an understatement: the promise those early releases hinted at is fully realized here, with ten songs of urgent, passionate guitar pop that elicit warm memories of bands past, from the Go-Betweens'' jangle to the charmingly lo-fi trappings of New Zealand''s Flying Nun label. But don''t mistake Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever for nostalgists: Hope Downs is the sound of a band finding its own collective voice. <br>The hard-hitting debut album is a testament to Rolling Blackouts C.F.’s tight-knit and hard-working bonafides. Prior to forming the band in 2013, singers/guitarists Fran Keaney, Tom Russo, and Joe White had played together in various garage bands, dating back to high school. When Rolling Blackouts C.F. started, with Joe Russo [Tom’s brother] on bass, Marcel [Tussie, Joe White''s then-housemate] on drums, the chemistry was immediate. After a split EP with You Yangs (another Russo brother''s band), released in the form of a frisbee, they self-released Talk Tight in 2015, which Sydney-based record label Ivy League gave a wider release the following year. Talk Tight garnered plaudits from critics, including legendary rock scribe Robert Christgau. In 2017, Sub Pop released The French Press EP, bringing the band''s chugging and tuneful non-linear indie rock to the rest of the world as they settled into their sound with remarkable ease. <br><br>Hope Downs was largely written over the past year in the band''s Melbourne rehearsal room where their previous releases were also written and recorded. The band''s core trio of songwriters hunkered down and wrote as the chaos of the world outside unavoidably seeped into the songwriting process. "We were feeling like we were in a moment where the sands were shifting and the world was getting a lot weirder. There was a general sense that things were coming apart at the seams and people around us were too,” Russo explains. The album title, taken from the name of a vast open cut mine in the middle of Australia, refers to the feeling of “standing at the edge of the void of the big unknown, and finding something to hold on to.” <br><br>With the help of engineer/producer Liam Judson and his portable setup, the band recorded Hope Downs live, and co-produced ten guitar pop gems over the course of two weeks in Northern New South Wales during the winter of 2017. Hope Downs possesses a robust full-band sound that''s all the more impressive considering the band''s avoidance of traditional recording studios. If you loved Talk Tight and The French Press, you certainly won''t be disappointed here—but you might also be surprised at how the band’s sound has grown. There''s a richness and weight to these songs that was previously only hinted at, from the skyscraping chorus of “Sister''s Jeans” to the thrilling climax of album closer “The Hammer.” <br><br>Hope Downs is as much about the people that populate the world around us—their stories, perspectives, and hopes in the face of disillusionment—as it is about the state of things at large. It''s a record that focuses on finding the bright spots at a time when cynicism all too often feels like the natural state. Rolling Blackouts C.F. are here to remind us to keep our feet on the ground—and Hope Downs is as delicious a taste of terra firma as you''re going to get from a rock band right now. <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Sub Pop Records', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks) / 24bit-48kHz FLAC (tracks)', '35:17', '83.8 / 244 / 447 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/zh6c0jp18irs/Hope_Downs_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-29 10:03:53.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-29 07:03:53', '2018-06-29 07:03:53'),

She can belt and she can tease; she can aim a note as directly as a missile or turn its trajectory into an aerobatic spiral of leaping, quivering, scalloping melismas. Her voice is not an instrument for making modest statements; it’s about peaks of self-affirmation, indescribable sensual pleasures, steely counterattacks and abysses of sorrow.<br><br>She unleashes all of them on “Liberation,” her eighth studio album and her first since “Lotus” in 2012. It’s a return to the pop fray after multiple seasons as a coach on “The Voice” that made sure viewers didn’t forget her vocal mastery. It’s an album of extreme ups and downs: wretched and ecstatic, calculating and abandoned, seesawing between angst and raunch. Heard as a whole — unlikely as that might be in 2018 — it’s an album that moves through trauma, lust, resistance, obsession and, finally, lasting love. Her extravagant vocal flourishes connect with sweeping emotion.<br><br>Top 10 pop — the realm where Ms. Aguilera has repeatedly proved herself since “Genie in a Bottle” in 1999 — doesn’t always reward big, natural voices as it once did, especially for singers who aren’t named Adele. Auto-Tune; hip-hop; and the nasal, narcotized, dispirited voices of SoundCloud rap compete with, and often out-stream, the kind of soulful vocal storytelling that would have had Ms. Aguilera flourishing in previous eras. A voice like hers has become something like a turntable: a vintage prize, a modern novelty, a niche taste.

The record features de-facto band leader Isaiah Barr on alto and tenor saxophone, Austin Williamson on drums, Walter Stinson on upright bass, Spencer Murphy on electric bass, and Roy Nathanson as guest saxophone on four tracks. A group of New York mainstays cross in and out of the Onyx universe and often performing live with the band, including Nick Hakim, Princess Nokia, Dev Hynes (Blood Orange), Wiki (Ratking), Julian Soto and Felix Pastorius. Onyx members quietly feature on a bevy of other artists’ records too, with Barr himself recently boasting 3 features on the new David Byrne album and making a cameo in Ibeyi’s live band for their performance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Whereas previous Onyx Collective projects capture New York City''s more romantic facets, Lower East Suite Part Three has a much more ominous sound, reflective of the dissonance that accompanies life in the city. After being forced out of their original practice space due to rising rent, Onyx Collective relocated their headquarters to Magic Gallery on Market St, located in a gritty pocket of Chinatown by the East River. “When I wrote the record I was thinking about concepts like eviction and gentrification,” explains Barr. “The record is born out of the challenges of being in New York.” <br><br>Recorded at Magic Gallery, Lower East Suite Part Three is the first release from Onyx Collective composed of entirely written music. “The record is a graduation for us - from not just having a microphone at a session and spontaneously recording,” says Barr. “This is us doing it on our own, with our own engineer, with a very low budget. That survival is really what I think jazz is: creating with your surroundings, and making something that''s a picture of that.” While the new music is more premeditated than the impromptu nature of their previous work, New York''s deafening influence remains present. “To some degree it''s controlled, but how much is it actually controlled?” continues Barr. “At the end of one of the songs you can still hear a siren from the street. Because we weren''t in a professional studio, it''s not a controlled environment. We''re still in New York.” <!--QuoteEnd-->', 'Big Dada', NULL, 'Mp3 320 kbps / FLAC (tracks)', '34:53', '83.5 / 214 MB', 'https://isra.cloud/qfc2a67onh86/Lower_East_Suite_Part_Three_FLAC.rar.html', 0, 'images/albums/album_image_2018-06-29 10:06:44.jpg', NULL, '2018-06-29 07:06:44', '2018-06-29 07:06:44');
